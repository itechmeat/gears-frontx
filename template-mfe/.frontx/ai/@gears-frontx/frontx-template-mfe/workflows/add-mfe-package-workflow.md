# Workflow: Add an MFE Package (template-mfe)

Ordered execution procedure for the `add-mfe-package` skill in this same bundle. Use
this workflow when actually performing the addition (not just reasoning about it);
each step names the concrete command or file template-mfe ships.

## Preconditions

- An applied `template-shell` is already in the project (root `package.json`,
  `src-app/app/`, build/test/manifest pipeline) — `template-mfe` adds MFE packages
  into that shell and does not scaffold a repository on its own.
- The screenset/screen the new MFE will contribute to is already decided.

## Steps

1. **Choose a name and port**
   - Name: `{screenset}-mfe` (kebab-case), placed at `src-app/mfe_packages/{screenset}-mfe/`.
   - Port: next free `30N0` slot after the reserved `3001` (`demo-mfe`).

2. **Copy the scaffold**
   ```bash
   cp -r src-app/mfe_packages/_blank-mfe src-app/mfe_packages/{screenset}-mfe
   ```

3. **Edit package metadata**
   - `src-app/mfe_packages/{screenset}-mfe/package.json`:
     - `name`: `@gears-frontx/{screenset}-mfe`
     - `dev`: `vite --port {port}`
     - `preview`: `vite preview --port {port}`
   - `src-app/mfe_packages/{screenset}-mfe/vite.config.ts`:
     - Module Federation `name`: `{screenset}Mfe` (camelCase)

4. **Rewrite `mfe.json`**
   - Delete `"templateExample": true`, copied in from the scaffold. It is what keeps
     the scaffold out of the running application; a package that keeps it is skipped
     by manifest generation and by `dev:all`, and its screen never reaches the menu.
   - Replace the manifest ID, every entry ID, and every extension ID using
     template-mfe's ID taxonomy (`gts-id-conventions` guideline; worked examples in
     `gts-id-patterns-reference`).
   - Update `remoteEntry` to `http://localhost:{port}/assets/remoteEntry.js`.

5. **Implement the screen**
   - Rename/replace `src/screens/home/HomeScreen.tsx` with the real screen.
   - Update `src/screens/home/i18n/*.json` (or rename the directory) with real copy
     for every locale the template ships.
   - Keep `src/lifecycle.tsx` extending `ThemeAwareReactLifecycle`; keep `init.ts`'s
     plugin chain (`effects()`, `queryCacheShared()`, `mock()`) unless the new MFE has
     a documented reason to diverge.

6. **Regenerate manifests**
   ```bash
   npm run build:mfes
   npm run generate:mfe-manifests
   ```

7. **Validate**
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   npm run arch:deps
   ```

8. **Run and confirm**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:all
   ```
   - Open the app, confirm the new screen mounts, and confirm zero console errors.

## Rollback

If the addition is abandoned before being committed: delete
`src-app/mfe_packages/{screenset}-mfe/`, re-run `npm run generate:mfe-manifests` to
drop it from `public/generated-mfe-manifests.json`, and revert any workspace/script
edits made in step 3.

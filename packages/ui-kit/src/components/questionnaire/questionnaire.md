# Questionnaire

A single-item-at-a-time multi-step form: one question visible at a time,
with progress, required/skip/invalid state, and keyboard shortcuts handled
for you. Behavior comes from **`@shadcn/react/questionnaire`**, a headless,
zero-runtime-dep engine — a dependency deviation from the kit's usual Base
UI foundation, taken because Base UI ships no multi-step-form primitive. This file supplies CSS
Modules styling, composes the kit `Button` for navigation and the kit
`Input` for freeform answers (matching upstream's own composition), and
hand-rolls the choice indicator (see `QuestionnaireChoice`'s doc comment
in `questionnaire.tsx` for why that one piece can't literally reuse the
kit's `Checkbox`/`RadioGroupItem` components).

Composition:

```text
Questionnaire                     root <form>, owns items + current item
├── QuestionnaireProgress
├── QuestionnaireItem             one per question, a <fieldset>
│   ├── QuestionnaireTitle        <legend>, the item's accessible name
│   ├── QuestionnaireDescription
│   ├── QuestionnaireChoices
│   │   ├── QuestionnaireChoice   ...one per fixed answer
│   │   └── QuestionnaireInput    optional freeform answer, last cell
│   └── QuestionnaireError
└── QuestionnaireActions
    ├── QuestionnairePrevious
    ├── QuestionnaireSkip
    ├── QuestionnaireNext
    └── QuestionnaireSubmit
```

## When to use

- A short, focused form best answered one question at a time — onboarding,
  a survey, a setup wizard — where seeing every field at once would
  overwhelm rather than help.

## When not to use

- A form where the user benefits from seeing multiple related fields
  together (an address, a billing profile) — compose `Field`/`Input`/
  `Select` directly instead.
- A long form the user is expected to skim, save, and return to — this
  component has no persistence or free navigation between arbitrary steps
  beyond Previous/Next.

## How advancing actually works

This is the part that most often surprises people, so it is stated plainly:

- **Navigation buttons never disable themselves.** Activating `Next` or
  `Submit` is what *runs* validation and reveals the failure. A disabled
  Next would leave the reader stuck with no explanation.
- **A required item is valid once it has an answer.**
- **An optional item is valid once it has an answer _or_ has been
  explicitly skipped.** An untouched optional item fails validation exactly
  like a required one — `Skip` is its way past, not `Next`.
- **`Submit` re-validates every enabled item**, not just the last one. The
  first failing item becomes active again and gets focus.
- **Skipping clears the item's answer** and removes it from the submitted
  `FormData` entirely. That is what distinguishes "deliberately declined"
  from "not answered yet"; observe it with `QuestionnaireItem`'s
  `onStatusChange` (`'unanswered' | 'answered' | 'skipped'`).
- **Selecting an answer never auto-advances**, including via shortcut.

Because a blocked `Next` is otherwise completely silent, **render a
`QuestionnaireError` inside every item**, not just the required ones. Its
default copy already adapts: "Choose an answer to continue." for a required
item, "Choose an answer or skip this question." for an optional one.

## Keyboard

| Key | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Move between answer controls and visible actions |
| `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` | Move between answers within the item; native radios also select |
| `ArrowLeft` | Previous item (when focus is outside a radio or text field) |
| `ArrowRight` | Next item, only once the item is answered or skipped |
| `Space` | Select a radio, toggle a checkbox, activate a focused action |
| `Enter` | Continue from a selected choice or a filled freeform input |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` | Validate and continue from anywhere; submits on the last item |
| assigned letter/number | Select that choice (with `shortcuts` on); does not advance |

Shortcuts and arrow navigation pause while typing in a text field.

## Props (kit level)

`Questionnaire` (root, a native `<form>`):

| Prop | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `items` | `{ name, choices?, required?, disabled? }[]` | The full question list — drives validation, ordering, and shortcut assignment independent of what's actually rendered |
| `item` / `defaultItem` | `string` | Controlled/uncontrolled current item name |
| `onItemChange` | `(item: string) => void` | |
| `shortcuts` | `'letters' \| 'numbers'` | Assigns `A`–`Z` / `1`–`9` to each enabled choice, in `items` order; disabled choices are skipped |
| `noValidate` | `boolean` | Defaults to `true` — suppresses native constraint bubbles while keeping questionnaire validation |

`QuestionnaireProgress`: renders `Question {current} of {total}` as text in
a `role="progressbar"` — it is **not** a bar by default. Pass `children` to
replace the copy, or `render={(props, state) => ...}` to draw a real bar
from `state.current`/`state.total` (see the demo's segmented example).

`QuestionnaireItem`: `name` (matches an `items` entry), `required`,
`multiple` (renders every child `QuestionnaireChoice` as a checkbox
instead of a radio), `invalid` (mark invalid from an external validator),
`disabled` (omit from progress and navigation), `onStatusChange`.

`QuestionnaireChoice`: `value`, `disabled`, `checked`/`defaultChecked`,
`onChange`. Renders the hidden native input, a checkbox-square or
radio-circle indicator (picked automatically from the parent item's
`multiple`), the label text (`children`), and its own shortcut cap.

`QuestionnaireChoiceDescription`: a second line under a choice's label.
Belongs among `QuestionnaireChoice`'s children.

`QuestionnaireInput`: any text `<input>` prop (`type`, `placeholder`,
`maxLength`, ...) plus `render` — defaults to composing the kit `Input`.
Belongs inside `QuestionnaireChoices` when an item offers both fixed
choices and a freeform answer, so the field sits on the choice grid.

Navigation (`QuestionnairePrevious`/`QuestionnaireSkip`/`QuestionnaireNext`/
`QuestionnaireSubmit`), each:

| Prop | Type | Default |
|------|------|---------|
| `variant` | kit `Button` variant | `'outline'` (Previous/Skip), `'default'` (Next/Submit) |
| `size` | kit `Button` size | `'default'` |
| `render` | element to render as | a kit `Button` |

Each is hidden (native `hidden`+`inert`, not just visually) when it
doesn't apply — `Previous` on the first item, `Skip` on a `required` item,
`Next` on the last item, `Submit` before it. `Next` and `Submit` share one
grid cell; exactly one is ever visible.

## Styling hooks

Every part carries data attributes you can key CSS off:

| Part | Attributes |
|------|-----------|
| `Progress` | `data-current`, `data-total`, `data-first`, `data-last` |
| `Item` | `data-active`, `data-status`, `data-required`, `data-multiple`, `data-disabled`, `data-invalid` |
| `Choices` | `data-shortcuts` |
| `Choice` | `data-type` (`radio`/`checkbox`), `data-checked`, `data-unchecked`, `data-disabled`, `data-invalid`, `data-shortcut` |
| `Input` | `data-filled`, `data-empty`, `data-disabled`, `data-invalid` |
| navigation | `data-visible`, `data-hidden`, `data-status`, `data-shortcut` |

> **If you add a `display` declaration to any part that the engine hides**
> (`Item`, `Error`, `ChoiceShortcut`, and the four navigation buttons),
> re-block it with a matching `[hidden] { display: none }` rule. The
> `hidden` attribute is enforced only by the UA stylesheet's
> non-`!important` rule, so any author `display` silently defeats it — and
> the entire questionnaire then paints every question at once.
> `questionnaire.module.css` carries that guard for the parts it styles.

## Deviations from upstream

- **Choice indicator is hand-rolled, not a `Checkbox`/`RadioGroupItem`
  composition.** Those kit components wrap Base UI's `Checkbox`/`Radio`
  primitives, which render as `<span role="checkbox"|"radio">` — never a
  real `<input>`. The questionnaire engine needs its `ChoiceInput` to BE a
  native input (constraint validation, `name`-based radio grouping), so
  this file instead re-implements the same visual language from
  `checkbox.module.css`/`radio-group.module.css` directly here, keyed off
  this element's own `data-type`/`data-checked`/`data-disabled`/
  `data-invalid` attributes.
- **`ChoiceInput`/`ChoiceLabel`/`ChoiceShortcut` are exported standalone.**
  Upstream only uses them internally inside its `QuestionnaireChoice`. This
  kit exports all three too, for a consumer building a fully custom choice
  layout without `QuestionnaireChoice`'s built-in indicator markup.
- **No manual default text.** Upstream's wrapper supplies `children ??
  'Previous'` (and similarly for Skip/Next/Submit/the progress text/the
  error message) because its underlying primitive renders nothing without
  it. The installed `@shadcn/react` version already supplies sensible
  default content for `QuestionnaireProgress`, `QuestionnaireError`, and
  each navigation button — this wrapper only forwards `children`/`render`
  when a consumer wants to override that default, it never hardcodes
  English strings that would need translating.
- **Token-scale spacing.** The kit's spacing scale has no 10px step, so
  upstream's `gap-2.5`/`py-2.5` inside a choice row land on `--space-2`
  (8px) here; the shortcut cap uses the kit's `--text-mono-size`, which
  the Studio blue rebrand moved to 10px — the same size upstream draws.
  Every other measurement (44px row, 16px indicator slot, 20px cap, 8px
  choice gap, 16px item and root gaps) matches upstream exactly. The choice
  row's own radius and its check glyph follow the design spec instead of
  upstream: a 6px corner and a 12px glyph inside the unchanged 16px slot.
- **Focus is the kit's field ring.** Upstream draws a 3px translucent halo
  outside the row; the kit's field idiom (`input.module.css`) is a
  recolored border plus an inset ring, so the choice row wears that
  instead — and, per the same kit ruling, an invalid row keeps the
  destructive treatment while focused.

## Examples

```tsx
import {
  Questionnaire,
  QuestionnaireActions,
  QuestionnaireChoice,
  QuestionnaireChoiceDescription,
  QuestionnaireChoices,
  QuestionnaireDescription,
  QuestionnaireError,
  QuestionnaireInput,
  QuestionnaireItem,
  QuestionnaireNext,
  QuestionnairePrevious,
  QuestionnaireProgress,
  QuestionnaireSkip,
  QuestionnaireSubmit,
  QuestionnaireTitle,
} from '@gears-frontx/ui-kit';

const items = [
  {
    name: 'direction',
    choices: [{ value: 'tool-calls' }, { value: 'approvals' }],
    required: true,
  },
  { name: 'signals', choices: [{ value: 'progress' }, { value: 'risks' }] },
];

function Onboarding() {
  return (
    <Questionnaire
      items={items}
      defaultItem="direction"
      shortcuts="letters"
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
    >
      <QuestionnaireProgress />

      <QuestionnaireItem name="direction" required>
        <QuestionnaireTitle>What should the agent build next?</QuestionnaireTitle>
        <QuestionnaireDescription>Choose a direction or describe another task.</QuestionnaireDescription>
        <QuestionnaireChoices>
          <QuestionnaireChoice value="tool-calls">
            Tool call timeline
            <QuestionnaireChoiceDescription>
              Show what the agent ran and what came back.
            </QuestionnaireChoiceDescription>
          </QuestionnaireChoice>
          <QuestionnaireChoice value="approvals">
            Approval checkpoints
            <QuestionnaireChoiceDescription>
              Ask before sensitive or destructive actions.
            </QuestionnaireChoiceDescription>
          </QuestionnaireChoice>
          <QuestionnaireInput aria-label="Another feature" placeholder="Describe another feature…" />
        </QuestionnaireChoices>
        <QuestionnaireError />
      </QuestionnaireItem>

      {/* `multiple` turns the radios into checkboxes; read with getAll(). */}
      <QuestionnaireItem name="signals" multiple>
        <QuestionnaireTitle>What should every update include?</QuestionnaireTitle>
        <QuestionnaireDescription>Select all that apply, or skip this question.</QuestionnaireDescription>
        <QuestionnaireChoices>
          <QuestionnaireChoice value="progress">Progress</QuestionnaireChoice>
          <QuestionnaireChoice value="risks">Risks</QuestionnaireChoice>
        </QuestionnaireChoices>
        <QuestionnaireError />
      </QuestionnaireItem>

      <QuestionnaireActions>
        <QuestionnairePrevious />
        <QuestionnaireSkip />
        <QuestionnaireNext />
        <QuestionnaireSubmit>Save plan</QuestionnaireSubmit>
      </QuestionnaireActions>
    </Questionnaire>
  );
}
```

Reading the result — a `multiple` item submits one entry per checked
choice, and a skipped item submits nothing:

```tsx
function handleSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
  event.preventDefault();
  const data = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
  const answers = {
    direction: data.get('direction'),
    signals: data.getAll('signals'), // [] when skipped
  };
}
```

## Anti-patterns

- Do not omit `QuestionnaireError` from an item because it is optional — a
  failed `Next` on an untouched optional item is then completely silent.
- Do not nest a `QuestionnaireChoiceShortcut` inside a
  `QuestionnaireChoice`'s children. `QuestionnaireChoice` already renders
  one; a second produces two key caps on the same row. The standalone
  export is for choice layouts built without `QuestionnaireChoice`.
- Do not render a `QuestionnaireChoice` for a value missing from the
  parent `QuestionnaireItem`'s `choices` in `items` — the engine warns
  (console) and the choice won't participate in validation/shortcuts.
- Do not reach for `Checkbox`/`RadioGroupItem` to restyle
  `QuestionnaireChoice`'s indicator — see "Deviations" above for why that
  swap breaks native input semantics the engine depends on. Restyle via
  `questionnaire.module.css`'s own classes/tokens instead.
- Do not assume `QuestionnaireNext`/`QuestionnaireSubmit` are mutually
  exclusive by conditional rendering — both should always be mounted
  (matching the examples above); the primitive hides whichever doesn't
  apply, which is also what lets its transition-free `hidden` swap happen
  without a flash of the wrong button.
- Do not gate `Next` behind your own `disabled` unless you also surface why
  it is blocked; the built-in design deliberately keeps it enabled so the
  error can speak.

# Contract harness pilot notes

Cost and deviation log for the component-contract pilot (Accordion,
DataTable). English, factual, one section per pilot component. Written by
the developer who built the harness, for whoever decides whether to extend
contract coverage past the two pilot components.

How the types the harness produces relate to each other is not repeated here:
the domain model - the diagram and the relationship table - lives in section
3.1 of the package DESIGN (`packages/ui-kit/architecture/DESIGN.md`), and the
numbered instructions the code carries markers into live in the feature spec
(`packages/ui-kit/architecture/features/component-contracts/FEATURE.md`).

Each section is written in the vocabulary that was in force when its
observation was made, so a field or a type named below may not be the name the
harness carries now. The last section, "The vocabulary described the harness,
not the component", holds the map from every retired name to its current one -
one place to read it rather than a parenthesis on every mention.

## A prop of the primitive is the component's API, not forwarded surface

**Observed.** Every prop declared outside the component's own file was filed
as inherited, and every inherited prop was written into a generated
passthrough type keyed by the ORIGIN of the declaration - one file per Base UI
primitive part, five of them, 224 to 233 properties each, 732 to 764 lines
each. Two things were wrong with that, and only one of them was about size.

The first is what an evaluation measured: an agent asked what Accordion's
`value` and `defaultValue` accept answered "plain strings". Those are the
root's own API - Base UI declares them in `AccordionRootProps`, the kit
forwards them, and `accordion.md` documents them as kit-level props - and they
were entry 200-something of a file whose title said "the props a kit component
forwards to an underlying `<div>`". Nine of the root's props were in there
with them: `multiple`, `onValueChange`, `hiddenUntilFound`, `keepMounted`,
`disabled`, `loopFocus`, `orientation`. A reader looking for the Accordion's
API found `className` and nothing else in `properties`.

The second is that the files were derived per component at all. React's DOM
attributes for a `<button>` are the same attributes for every component that
renders one, so five derivations produced five near-copies whose only real
differences came from the compilation that printed them - a union's member
order, an `import("...")` specifier - which is why the harness needed an origin
key, a collision check, a `generated_from` ownership list and a freshness
comparison to keep five copies of one fact from overwriting each other.

**Changed.** The extractor files a prop by its declaration site into one of
three sets (`classifyDeclarationSite`): the component's own source, the
primitive library's props for the part it wraps, or React's DOM attribute
types. The middle set reaches the contract's own `properties` next to the
declared props, with its real type where the provider-safe subset can express
one and the checker's printed type text where it cannot. React's attributes go
through one hand-written schema per host element - `passthrough/dom_button.json`,
`passthrough/dom_div.json`, about forty lines each: the common attributes, the
element's own, and the `^aria-`/`^data-`/`^on[A-Z]` patterns. A prop declared
in none of the three places is named in `unclassifiedProps` and the compiler
refuses the component, because which side of the line it falls on is a
question about that library's conventions.

Accordion's root went from 1 property to 11, and `value`/`defaultValue` now
carry `TS: AccordionValue<Value> | undefined` where the file used to carry
`{}`. Button went from 6 to 9. The five generated files, the origin registry
(`resolvePassthroughOrigin`, `baseUiOriginFromDeclarationFile`), the collision
check, `generated_from` and the generated files' freshness comparison are all
gone: with one hand-written file per element there is no ownership to track and
nothing to regenerate.

**Decisions taken along the way.**

- **The origin key is gone, but comparing the surface across a move is not.**
  The origin registry existed to keep five derivations apart; nothing keeps two
  hand-written files apart, so it went with them. The compatibility check still
  reads the host element from BOTH revisions of a contract and compares the two
  surfaces: a component re-rendered from a `<button>` over a `<div>` stops
  forwarding `type`, `form`, `name`, `disabled`, `value` and `autoFocus`, which
  is a real narrowing a consumer feels. Dropping that comparison along with the
  registry would have reopened a hole closed one commit earlier.
- **Only the element kinds the kit renders are committed.** `dom_button` and
  `dom_div` are what the three described components resolve; `dom_anchor` and
  `dom_input` are not written, because a committed schema no contract names
  is a file nothing checks and nothing reads. A kind with no file fails the
  compile by name, which is the point at which somebody decides what that
  element accepts.
- **No overlay field for the host element.** The extractor resolves it for all
  seven contracts, and a component with forwarded DOM props and no resolvable
  element is refused naming the props - the same shape as the refusal for props
  whose declaration site cannot be placed. An authored `element:` would be a
  second writable statement of a fact the extractor owns, in the same commit
  that removed one of those from `composition.parent`.
- **`className` stays a declared prop.** Every kit component redeclares it
  narrower than Base UI's `string | ((state) => string)`, and the element
  surface declares it as a plain string. The two agree, and the contract
  carries the component's own declaration - the element surface is a shared
  statement about the element, not a claim to own the name.

## Composition: children optional, parent derived

**Observed.** `composition.children` was required, so a component with no
answer had to invent one: DataTable said `kinds: [none]` (correct - it renders
its Table internally), but a layout component that accepts whatever a consumer
puts in it had only two options, both false - enumerate a kit it does not know,
or claim `text`. And `composition.parent` was authored, which made it a claim
about somebody else's contract: AccordionTrigger stated "I go inside
AccordionItem" while AccordionItem's own `children` list was free not to
mention triggers at all. The pair could disagree, and only a conformance test
comparing them would ever notice.

**Changed.** `children` is optional; its absence means unconstrained, and
`none` keeps its exclusivity - a list that pairs it with anything else says
both that nothing may appear inside and that something may. `text` gained a
definition in the vocabulary type rather than in prose beside it: a
non-component React node - a string, a number, a fragment, a formatted inline
element - never a kit component, which would be a reference instead. `parent`
is computed at compile time from every other overlay's `children.kinds`
(`deriveParentKinds`) and an overlay that writes it is refused, pointing at
`mounts_in`. The two directions of one relationship cannot disagree any more,
because there is one statement and `parent` is a view of it.

**Decisions taken along the way.**

- **Derived from overlays, not from committed contracts.** An overlay is the
  authored source, so a derivation taken from it is right even while a
  committed contract is stale - which is the state every recompile passes
  through. It costs a directory listing and a YAML parse per described
  component; no TypeScript program is built.
- **A third widening signal for the guard.** Because a children list decides
  another component's derived parent, an overlay edit can move a contract in a
  directory the change never touched. `touchesAnyOverlay` widens the guard to
  every covered component, kept distinct from the tooling and allowlist
  signals so the guard's own output still says which reason applied.
- **A mount point outside the kit takes the external form, under its own key.**
  `composition.mounts_in` is authored and merged into the derived `parent`, the
  same `{ external, note }` shape `dont_use_when.instead` already uses. It is a
  separate key because `parent` is not authorable: DataTableSortButton's real
  mount point is a `ColumnDef`'s `header` render function, which TanStack Table
  owns, and the typed reference covers kit-to-kit nesting only.

## Assumption kinds, and the pairing they make checkable

**Observed.** `coverage.assumptions` was a `claim`/`reason` pair, and four
entries across three overlays said "JSON Schema has no notion of a generic type
parameter" in four different sentences. Nothing could tell that family of claim
apart from "this part wraps two Base UI primitives" or "its mount point is
outside the kit", so nothing could ask the question those four sentences were
answering by accident: does every prop the schema cannot type have an entry?

**Changed.** Every assumption carries a `kind` from a closed list -
`untyped_prop`, `hidden_part`, `external_mount`, `behaviour` - and
`untyped_prop` also names its `prop`, checked against the extracted prop list
the way `deprecations.props` keys are. The conformance suite then pairs the two
sides both ways (`findUntypedPropMismatches`): a property that asserts nothing
must have an `untyped_prop` assumption naming it, and an assumption naming a
property the schema DOES constrain is a claim about a different contract. The
three pilots carry 24 `untyped_prop` assumptions between them, which is the
number of properties across seven contracts that Ajv will not check.

**Decisions taken along the way.**

- **The pairing is over what asserts nothing, not over one description
  wording.** A declared slot carries `Slot: ...` and an API prop the schema
  cannot type carries `TS: ...` - two wordings because they are documented in
  two places (`x-uikit.slots` for the kit's own slots, the description plus the
  assumption for a forwarded API prop). The check reads the schema keywords
  instead, so it cannot be fooled by either wording changing.
- **Reported by the conformance suite, not by the compiler.** A missing
  assumption is a documentation gap; a compile that refused it would make a
  component uncompilable until its prose caught up, which is the wrong order.
  The suite fails on it in the run the author already executes.
- **`hidden` is one honest use, not a convenience, and it carries its own
  reason.** Accordion's root hides Base UI's `orientation`: the kit's own
  stylesheet fixes `.root` to `flex-direction: column`, so the only value it
  could add - `horizontal` - would set Base UI's keyboard axis against the
  layout the kit renders. That sentence is the entry's `reason` field: an
  entry is a prop and the reason it is not advertised, so the reason sits
  where the omission is instead of in a second claim beside it. Nothing
  else is hidden. AccordionContent's `keepMounted` and `hiddenUntilFound` were
  considered and left visible: `accordion.md` documents them on the root, but
  the panel really does accept them, and hiding a working typed boolean because
  a document is terse would remove a true fact rather than a misleading one.
  What the overlay says instead is a `behaviour` assumption naming where they
  are usually set.

## Accordion

### What Accordion is, contract-wise

`accordion.tsx` exports four components from one file - `Accordion` (root),
`AccordionItem`, `AccordionTrigger`, `AccordionContent` - each wrapping a
different Base UI Accordion primitive part. Until this point the harness
assumed one component, one directory, one overlay, one compiled contract.
Accordion is the first component that breaks that assumption three separate
ways at once: several public exports in one directory, a compound "family"
relationship between them, and one export (`Accordion<Value>`) that is
generic.

### Deviation 1: one contract per export, not a schema-chained family

An earlier plan for this work proposed chaining the family through
the GTS type system itself - `AccordionItem`'s props schema deriving from
`Accordion`'s. That was corrected before implementation: a schema-level
`root -> item` derivation would make `AccordionItem` inherit `Accordion`'s
own props (`multiple`, `hiddenUntilFound`, ...), which is factually wrong -
an item does not have those - and `GtsStore.validateSchemaAgainstParent`
would then reject item-only props (`value`, `disabled`) as undeclared
additions under a base the derivation treats as closed.

What shipped instead: **four independent contracts**, each its own derived
type from `base.component` and from nothing else, with
ids kept flat via `gtsToken` (`accordion-item` -> `accordion_item`, one
token, so the "5 dot-tokens per segment" GTS grammar is unaffected by the
dash). Family membership moved out of the schema and into the metamodel
INSTANCE: a new optional `family` field (`root` ref, `role: root | part`,
`parts` on the root only), checked by a conformance test that every `family`
ref resolves to a directory that ships a compiled contract - a structural
relationship enforced by a test, not by inheritance.

Everywhere a plan or a metamodel description spoke of the compiled contract
"deriving" a family relationship, that language was replaced with the more
accurate "each export derives independently from base.component; family
membership is recorded, not inherited."

### Deviation 2: one passthrough type per DOM element kind, shared kit-wide

The harness through Button built the passthrough type as ONE FILE PER DOM
ELEMENT KIND, shared kit-wide, implicitly assuming every component that
resolves to a given kind (`div`, `button`, ...) forwards the same inherited
prop set. That held by coincidence: Button was the only `button`-kind
component, so nothing tested the assumption.

Accordion broke it twice over, confirmed by compiling both components and
diffing their generated passthrough output before deciding anything:

- `AccordionTrigger` also resolves to kind `button` (same as Button). Their
  inherited-prop sets were ALMOST identical (same underlying native
  `<button>` attributes) but not byte-identical: the checker printed the
  native `type`/`popover` attribute unions in a DIFFERENT member order
  depending on which component's own Props type led it to them - a
  pre-existing TypeScript union-printing instability the harness had never
  been exposed to before two components shared a kind.
- `Accordion`, `AccordionItem` and `AccordionContent` all resolve to `div`,
  but forwarded genuinely different sets: the root alone carried nine
  accordion-specific fields (`value`, `multiple`, `onValueChange`,
  `hiddenUntilFound`, ...) that were inherited-by-declaration-file even
  though they are the root's own domain API.

Both halves of that are now answered by the filing rule at the top of this
file rather than by a key: the root's nine fields are its API and reach its
own `properties`, and what remains - React's attributes for a `<div>` - is
one hand-written file per element kind, so there is no derivation whose
printed output could depend on which component compiled it. The
origin-keyed generated files this deviation shipped, and the collision check
and ownership list they needed, are gone; the "one file per element kind"
shape it started from is what the harness ended up with, for the reason it
could not have then: nothing is derived, so nothing can disagree.

### Deviation 3: `composition.kinds` had to become typed refs

The pre-Accordion harness's `composition.children.kinds` was a plain array of
free-form strings (Button's overlay: `kinds: [text]`) - no schema-level
connection to the GTS component-ref grammar `dont_use_when.instead` already
used. Describing a family's actual allowed children (`Accordion` -> only
`AccordionItem`; `AccordionItem` -> `AccordionTrigger` and
`AccordionContent`) as free text would have been a strictly weaker fact than
`dont_use_when` already carried for the SAME kind of claim ("point at a real
component, not a name nothing can resolve"). Fixed by typing `children.kinds`
items as `oneOf: [component_type_ref, {const: "text"}]` - the one
non-component content-kind already in real use (Button) stays valid, and any
component-shaped entry is now checked the same way `dont_use_when` is.

Accordion also needed a place for a part's allowed mount points
(`AccordionTrigger`/`AccordionContent` under `AccordionItem`, `AccordionItem`
under `Accordion`) - nothing before it was ever "only ever mounted under"
something else. That shipped as an authored `composition.parent`, and is now
derived from the children lists instead: see "Composition: children optional,
parent derived" above for why an authored mirror of somebody else's fact was
the wrong shape for it.

### Deviation 4: the generic `Value` type parameter

`Accordion<Value = unknown>` makes `value`, `defaultValue` and
`onValueChange` depend on a type parameter with no JSON Schema
representation, so `classifyProviderSafeType` can express none of the three
and each reaches the contract as a property that asserts nothing. What that
needed was not a compiler change but a place to WRITE DOWN that it is
deliberate rather than a gap: `coverage.assumptions`, a new optional
sub-field of the existing `coverage` object (additive, Button's
`coverage: { a11y, rtl }` was unaffected), asserted present by the
conformance test. No custom JSON Schema keyword was added.

Two things about those three props changed after this deviation shipped, both
recorded at the top of this file: they are the root's API and reach its own
`properties` rather than a generated forwarded surface, and their assumptions
now carry `kind: untyped_prop` and name the prop, so the pairing between "a
property Ajv will not check" and "an assumption saying why" is checkable
instead of a convention.

The same `coverage.assumptions` mechanism also documents a second, unrelated
fact about `AccordionTrigger`: it composes Base UI's `Accordion.Header` (not
separately exposed by the kit) around `Accordion.Trigger` into one exported
component, so the contract describes the exported surface, not the two-part
internal composition. That entry now carries `kind: hidden_part`.

### Deviation 5: the extractor needed no change

An earlier plan anticipated a possible extractor fix "if the extractor
cannot resolve a kind for some export." It could, for all four: a probe run
against `accordion.tsx` before any extractor changes were considered
resolved `Accordion` -> `div`, `AccordionItem` -> `div`, `AccordionTrigger`
-> `button`, `AccordionContent` -> `div`, correctly, through the SAME
generic checker walk (`walkPropsType`/`typeRefParts`) that already followed
Button's `Omit<ButtonPrimitive.Props, 'className'>` down to
`BaseUIComponentProps<'button', ...>` - `AccordionPrimitive.Root.Props<Value>`
is a qualified name (`lastEntityName` already takes the last segment) and the
checker resolves its own heritage the same way regardless of how many
namespace segments got it there. `extract.test.ts` was not extended.

### Text changes to Button's committed artifacts

Two of Button's committed files changed content in this same commit for
reasons unrelated to Accordion's own facts:

- `scripts/contracts/ui-component.meta.json` - regenerated from
  `buildMetamodel()` after the `family`, `coverage.assumptions` and
  `composition.parent` additions (all additive/optional; Button's own
  compiled contract properties were unaffected).
- Button's own generated passthrough type, whose description was rewritten
  to describe the general per-export mechanism rather than the "one file per
  kind, no exceptions" wording Accordion falsified.

Both were required by the harness's own freshness invariant (a committed
artifact must equal a fresh compile) - not scope creep, the direct
consequence of the compiler producing different output for the SAME inputs.
The second file no longer exists: the forwarded surface is hand-written per
element kind and nothing regenerates it.

### What a compound component forced in the harness

A file-by-file inventory used to stand here. It is struck rather than
corrected: two of its entries named machinery the harness has since replaced,
and a list of function names in a log goes stale the moment the code moves.
What the shape change was:

- Every entry point that produces or compares an artifact takes an optional
  export stem beside the directory it already took, defaulting to the
  directory, so a compound directory's part resolves its own overlay,
  extraction and committed artifacts while every earlier call site keeps
  working unchanged.
- The guard and the compatibility check moved from one unit per directory to
  one per `(directory, stem)` pair, and a covered directory needs EVERY
  export described rather than one; the coverage report gained its
  per-directory "n of m exports" breakdown.
- The overlay vocabulary gained `family` and `coverage.assumptions`, both
  optional, so no instance is required to state them.
- The CLI entry point changed from "compile one component" to "compile every
  `*.contract.yaml` overlay directly under this directory".
- The per-component forwarded surface these deviations started from is gone
  entirely; the first section of this file records the hand-written
  per-element surface that replaced it, and `composition.parent` went the
  same way - derived from every other overlay's children rather than
  authored, see "Composition: children optional, parent derived".

### Effort

Roughly two focused working days (~14-16 hours) end to end: reading the
existing harness and Base UI's prop-declaration conventions, probing the
extractor and passthrough generation against real `accordion.tsx` output
before writing any overlay content (this is what surfaced Deviation 2 before
it became a silent bug), the metamodel/compiler/check.ts changes themselves,
authoring four overlays with real invariants and examples (not placeholders),
and the 22-assertion conformance suite. The single largest cost was NOT
Accordion's own facts - the four overlays took about the time Button's one
did - it was discovering and fixing the passthrough-sharing assumption
before it shipped a non-deterministic build.

## DataTable

### What DataTable is, contract-wise

`data-table.tsx` exports eight names; two are React components
(`DataTable`, `DataTableSortButton`), the other six are a fixed
TanStack-features const, a type alias for it, two helper functions and a
small labels interface. Unlike Accordion, DataTable and DataTableSortButton
are NOT a compound family - they are two independent top-level exports that
happen to share a directory, so neither overlay sets `family`. Both props
types are from-scratch interfaces with no `Omit<...>`/`ComponentProps<...>`
heritage at all - `DataTableProps` extends nothing, `DataTableSortButtonProps`
extends nothing - so neither names a host element surface at all, confirmed
by `resolveTargetExtraction(...)`
reporting no host element and no forwarded or API props for either (asserted
directly in `data-table.contract.test.ts`).

### Forced change 1: coverage must count components, not exports

Before this pilot, `componentExportCoverage` counted `extractComponent(...).length`
against `overlayStems(...).length` and called the first number "total
exports" - accidentally correct through Accordion because Button and every
Accordion export IS a component, so "extracted" and "exported" never
diverged. DataTable's directory exports six non-component names alongside
its two components, and NONE of them should ever need an overlay or count
against coverage. The extractor's own `isReactComponentCandidate` (uppercase
name, JSX-returning body) already excluded them correctly from
`extractComponent`'s result - the actual gap was that coverage had no way to
SHOW which names were excluded and why, leaving "2 of 6" reading as an
ambiguous fraction instead of "2 components, 4 correctly not-components".
Fixed with a new `extract.ts` export, `listExportedDeclarationNames` (every
top-level exported name in a file, component or not, gathered by the same
program/checker `extractComponent` already builds), and a
`skippedNonComponents` field on `DirectoryExportCoverage` that
`check.ts`'s `runCoverage` now prints alongside the n-of-m count.

### Forced change 2: extension_points

DataTable's growth surface is a small, fixed set of exports
(`columns`, `dataTableColumnHelper`, `dataTableSelectionColumn`,
`dataTableFeatures`) rather than a long tail of individual plugin-shaped
props - the metamodel had no field for "here is how a consumer extends this
component" as a first-class concept, only individual typed/slotted props.
`extension_points` (name/kind: prop\|helper\|feature/description/typed_by) is
an optional array on the metamodel instance, outside `required`, so a
component with no growth surface states nothing. `typed_by` is free text,
not a component reference: the governing type
(`@tanstack/react-table`'s `ColumnDef`) lives in a package this contract has
no business re-typing, so a prose pointer is the honest claim.

### Forced change 3: a `none` composition child kind

`composition.children.kinds` required at least one entry, drawn from
`component_type_ref` or the literal `"text"` - both Button and every
Accordion part have SOME notion of children (text, or a named part).
DataTable has neither: `DataTableProps` declares no `children` field at
all, and the component renders `Table`/`TableHeader`/`TableBody` internally
from `columns`/`data`. Writing `kinds: [text]` would have been a factual
lie (there is no way to pass text children to `<DataTable>` and have
anything happen). Added a third literal, `"none"`, to the same `oneOf` -
additive, existing `"text"` and component-ref values stay valid, no
metamodel version bump.

### Forced change 4 (not anticipated going in): absolute paths inside printed type text

Compiling DataTable's first overlay draft against the real extractor
surfaced a defect unrelated to anything above: `columns`' printed type text
(`checker.typeToString(..., NoTruncation)`) embedded the machine's own
ABSOLUTE FILESYSTEM PATH inside `import("...")` qualifiers -
TypeScript's printer falls back to a full `import()` path whenever
`NoTruncation` forces a structural, unnamed type to print in full and the
checker has no nominal name for it (`DataTableFeatures` traces back to an
inferred `tableFeatures(...)` return type with none). Left as committed
text, this would have made `data-table.contract.json` different on every
machine that recompiles it - the exact defect `relativeDeclarationFile`
already existed to prevent for declaration FILE paths, just not yet for
paths appearing INSIDE a printed type. Fixed by reusing
`relativeDeclarationFile`'s own normalization inside a new
`normalizeImportPathsInTypeText`, applied to every extracted prop's
`typeText` (own and inherited alike) at the point the checker prints it -
not a DataTable-specific patch, so any future component with an
unnamed/structural inherited type gets the same protection for free. This
was found only by actually compiling against the real component, the same
way Accordion's Deviation 2 was - neither is discoverable by reading the harness
or the component's source in isolation.

### What could not be expressed

- **Generics** (`TData` on both components, `TValue` on
  `DataTableSortButton`): no JSON Schema representation for a type
  parameter; every prop that depends on one collapses to an annotation-only
  slot, the same mechanism Accordion's `Value` generic already exercised -
  no new compiler code needed here, only the fact recorded in
  `coverage.assumptions`.
- **Function props** (`selectionSummary`, and every `ColumnDef`'s own
  `header`/`cell` render functions reached through `columns`): opaque past
  "a function", same treatment as any other function prop in the kit;
  `header`/`cell` specifically are never even visible to the extractor as
  named properties of `DataTableProps` - they live one level down, inside
  `columns`' element type, which is exactly why they are described as an
  `extension_point` rather than chased into deeper schema.
- **A runtime object prop** (`DataTableSortButton`'s `column: Column<...>`):
  a live TanStack instance with methods (`toggleSorting`, `getIsSorted`),
  not serializable data - annotation-only, same as Accordion's Base-UI-owned
  inherited props, just arriving through an OWN prop instead of an
  inherited one this time.
- **Internal state** (`sorting`/`rowSelection`/`pagination`): never reaches
  either props type at all, so there is nothing for the extractor to even
  see - not a gap, a non-issue, but worth stating: "DataTable is
  sortable/selectable/paginated" is not discoverable from its own compiled
  prop schema, only from `columns`' fields and `enableRowSelection`.
- **A typed composition parent for `DataTableSortButton`**: its real mount
  point is a `ColumnDef`'s `header` render function, a plain function prop
  TanStack Table owns, not a kit component - there is no `component_type_ref`
  for "a table header cell" to put in `composition.parent`. It was recorded
  in `coverage.assumptions` prose at the time; it now states the mount point
  in `composition.mounts_in`, the external form the derived `parent` merges
  in, with the assumption carrying `kind: external_mount` beside it.

### Effort

About half a working day (~4 hours): both props types were from-scratch
interfaces with no Base UI/DOM heritage to resolve, so there was no
Accordion-scale extractor exploration needed - the actual time went into
the absolute-path defect (found, diagnosed and fixed against the real
`columns` type, not anticipated from reading the plan) and writing two
honest overlays with real invariants/assumptions rather than placeholders.
Four forced harness changes for two contracts, a higher ratio than
Accordion's one (`resolvePassthroughKindKey`, since removed) for four -
DataTable's facts were individually smaller but touched more DIFFERENT
corners of the metamodel (coverage counting, composition vocabulary,
extension surface, and a portability bug outside the overlay vocabulary
entirely) rather than one deep problem repeated four times.

### Comparison: Button / Accordion / DataTable

| | Button | Accordion (4 contracts) | DataTable (2 contracts) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overlay lines (yaml, all contracts in the directory) | 85 | 275 (102+58+59+56) | 219 (137+82) |
| Own props: typed vs annotation-only (slot), summed across the directory's contracts | 5 typed, 1 slot | 4 typed, 0 slots | 4 typed, 8 slots |
| Host element / forwarded surface | `button` (`passthrough/dom_button.json`) | `div` for the root, item and panel, `button` for the trigger - two hand-written surfaces across four contracts | none for either contract - no DOM/Base UI heritage on either props type |
| Properties in the compiled contract | 9 (2 axes, 4 declared, 3 Base UI API) | 11 root, 6 item, 4 trigger, 5 panel (1 declared each, the rest Base UI API) | 9 and 3, all declared |
| Harness/compiler changes this component forced | 0 (harness already fit it - the original harness was built FOR Button) | `family`, `coverage.assumptions`, a composition parent, `composition.kinds` typed as refs, the (since removed) passthrough-key scoping fix | coverage counts components not exports, `extension_points`, a `none` composition child kind, absolute-path normalization in printed type text |

The typed-vs-slot ratio is the sharpest signal in that table: Button and
Accordion both wrap a Base UI primitive whose own props are mostly
provider-safe types (`boolean`, `string`, string-literal unions) reaching
their contracts as API props, so their DECLARED props (the ones this table
counts) are a small, mostly-typeable set on top of that. DataTable has no
such floor underneath it - every one of its own props is either provider-safe
(`pageSize`, `enableRowSelection`, `className`) or fully opaque (`columns`,
`data`, three `ReactNode` labels, `selectionSummary`) with nothing in
between, because there is no underlying primitive contributing a typed
baseline the way Base UI does for the other two.

## The x-gts-traits hybrid (demo review follow-up)

The type-system maintainer's review of the demo asked what `x-uikit` is - not
a JSON Schema keyword, not a registered GTS trait, an undifferentiated bag
every overlay field landed in regardless of whether anything downstream
actually read it. Two follow-on proposals came out of that thread: move the WHOLE overlay into `x-gts-traits`
(validated by gts-ts itself) and drop the compiled `.instance.json`
artifact, since the trait-typed props schema would carry everything the
instance did. Implemented instead: a hybrid split, `SEMANTIC_FIELD_TARGETS`
in compile.ts.

**What moved and why.** A field a validator or lint actually reads -
`dont_use_when` (its `instead` is a typed GTS ref, checked by pattern),
`composition`, `deprecations`, `coverage` (including `assumptions`),
`family`, `extension_points` - now compiles into `x-gts-traits`, checked by
`GTS.validateEntity` against `base.component.json`'s new
`x-gts-traits-schema` (`GtsStore.validateSchemaAgainstParent` ->
`validateSchemaTraits`, plus `validateEntityTraits`'s closure check - see
button.contract.test.ts's "button contract in a GTS store" suite for both
call paths exercised directly). A field that is prose FOR A READER with no
validator on the other end - `intent`, `typical_uses`, `invariants`,
`anti_patterns`, `examples` - stays in `x-uikit`, which nothing but a human
or a doc generator ever reads. The split is what makes `x-uikit` a definite
thing rather than a bag: it is specifically the half nothing validates.

**Two gts-ts mechanics this hybrid had to work around, neither documented
anywhere gts-ts ships (no README section, no test in its own `tests/`
directory mentions traits - this was worked out by reading
`GtsStore.validateSchemaTraits`/`validateEntityTraits`/
`collectAllTraitProperties` in `node_modules/@globaltypesystem/gts-ts/src/store.ts`
and confirming against the real package, see testing.ts's
`validateContractTraits` for the confirmed API):

1. `GtsStore.resolveTraitSchemaRefs` treats ANY `$ref`/`$$ref` key as a GTS
   ENTITY id to resolve in the store - it has no concept of a local JSON
   Schema pointer into the trait schema's own `$defs`, and fails a trait
   schema carrying one with "Unresolvable trait schema reference" rather
   than a recognizable validation error. Every trait-routed field is
   therefore a reference to a registered vocabulary type
   (`gts.frontx.uikit.trait.*`, one per concept - see "The overlay
   vocabulary as GTS types" below and the domain model in the package
   DESIGN), which is the shape that resolver is built for; the local `$defs`
   the metamodel still carries are string grammars used only by fields no
   validator reads.
2. `GtsStore.validateSchemaTraits`'s "unresolved trait property" check
   demands EVERY property `x-gts-traits-schema` declares have either a
   provided value or a schema `default`, regardless of this JSON Schema's
   own `required` list - checked with the `in` operator, before Ajv ever
   sees the data. `family` and `extension_points` are optional in the
   overlay (most components set neither), so a component that omits both
   would otherwise fail this check on its own, real, committed contract -
   not a demo artifact, `GTS.validateEntity` on the shipped
   `<name>.contract.json`. `nullableTraitProperty` (compile.ts) wraps
   exactly those two fields' type with `| null` and a schema-level
   `default: null`: `properties`/`required`/`minItems`/`if`/`then` are all
   instance-type-scoped JSON Schema keywords, vacuously satisfied by a
   `null` instance, so the real shape is unchanged for a component (like
   Accordion's root) that DOES set the field.

**Instance artifact (`<stem>.contract.instance.json`) kept, the suggestion
to drop it declined.** The same thread proposed folding the instance away
once traits carried everything the metamodel described. It is kept because
the two artifacts serve different readers with different costs: the
INSTANCE is what a catalog, a plan validator, or a lint rule reads without
loading JSON Schema machinery at all - `intent`, `dont_use_when`,
`composition` and the rest as a plain typed object, one `JSON.parse` and a
metamodel-shaped Ajv check, no derivation chain to walk, no host-element
surface to resolve, no GTS store to register into. The PROPS SCHEMA (and its
`x-gts-traits` annotation) is what a schema-aware validator or a
structured-output projection reads - the shape `GTS.validateEntity`,
`gtsPlugin.registerSchema` and Ajv itself all expect. Merging them would
mean every instance-only reader either takes on the derived-schema
machinery it never needed, or the compiler emits a "props-schema-shaped
view with the derivation stripped out" - a THIRD artifact in substance, not
a saved one. Two artifacts, two readers, one compiler that keeps them in
sync (the freshness check) is the cheaper shape.

**What changes if ADR 0005 answers "a GTS runtime acts on traits" versus
"validate-and-store only".** This hybrid assumes the latter: `x-gts-traits`
today is checked and carried, nothing reads it at runtime to change
behavior. If ADR 0005 settles on "validate-and-store", nothing here changes
- the split already matches that answer. If it settles on "a runtime acts on
traits", the DOCUMENTATION fields currently left in `x-uikit` (`intent`,
`typical_uses`, `invariants`, `anti_patterns`, `examples`) would need to
move too, since "a runtime reads this" is exactly the bar `SEMANTIC_FIELD_TARGETS`
already uses to decide what belongs in `x-gts-traits` - at that point
`x-uikit` would carry nothing (or fold away entirely) and the whole overlay
would be traits, which is the "move everything" version the maintainer
originally proposed. The map is the single edit point either way; no other
file changes shape.

## Decisions taken from the demo review

Five questions came out of the demo review. What follows is the
call on each, for whoever extends contract coverage past these three pilot
directories - not a re-litigation, a record of what was decided and why.

**1. Source of truth stays the code; YAML holds meaning, not shape.**
The type-system maintainer proposed Option B: YAML declares props/axes,
TypeScript is GENERATED from YAML (`button.contract.d.ts`), `cva()` stays in
code but is typed against the generated union, and the extractor flips from
"read the code" to "verify the code matches the YAML". Option A - the code
stays the one place props/axes are declared, the extractor reads them, the
overlay only carries what code cannot express - was hardened instead:
`check.ts`'s `compat` subcommand diffs a component's committed props
schema against the same component at a base ref via gts-ts's
`GTS.checkCompatibility`, and fails the build on an incompatible verdict
unless the component's own contract major also moved. That is Option A's own
answer to the concern Option B was raised to solve - "a removed variant
breaks consumers silently" - without inverting which side is generated. The
answer only holds because the major is PER COMPONENT, authored in that
component's overlay: read off a kit-wide constant, as it was at first, the
one acknowledgement the gate offers could only be given by rewriting the
identifier of every contract, every instance and every reference in the kit
at once, and a gate whose escape hatch costs that much is a gate people route
around rather than a gate that catches anything. B is declined for a
narrower reason than "A already works": the compiled JSON, not YAML-derived
TypeScript, is the one artifact this contract format claims is normative -
`gtsPlugin.registerSchema`, a projection into a structured-output schema, or
a validator in another language all read the compiled JSON, never a
`.d.ts`. Other kits (should this format ever leave this pilot) would extract
their own language's types from that JSON however suits their own tooling;
generating ONE language's types here would make that one language's shape
look normative when it is not. The tradeoff B's author named honestly - "one
YAML diff plus JSON diffs of the same fact" on every prop change - is
accepted as the cost of keeping the compiled artifact the single normative
one.

**2. Vendor namespace stays `frontx.uikit`; the slot above `component` is
empty.** The harness reviewer proposed a type id shaped
`gts.frontx.design.uikit.component.v1~`. The reply at the time explained that
the type needed a segment `frontx.uikit.component.v1` could not supply -
gts-ts's grammar requires 5-6 dot-tokens per segment and that string is 4 -
and shipped `gts.frontx.uikit.base.component.v1~` instead. That reply
conflated two things: needing a fifth token, and needing the word `base`. The
reviewer's proposal does supply a fifth token, legitimately.

Settled now, with three candidates on the table:

```
(a) gts.frontx.uikit.base.component.v1~       base pads the slot
(b) gts.frontx.uikit._.component.v1~          the slot carries nothing
(c) gts.frontx.design.uikit.component.v1~     the slot carries uikit
```

(b) is adopted. `_` is what the GTS spec reserves for a namespace slot that is
not applicable, and inside `uikit` there is no category above `component`: a
word there either restates the package or names a position in a hierarchy,
which is what made `base` wrong. (c) is declined: `uikit` is already the
package token in every id in this repository and in the GTS plugin package, so
(c) moves `VENDOR_PACKAGE` for every artifact here and there in exchange for a
word that adds no category. gts-ts accepts all three - its segment-token
grammar is `^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$` with no special case for `_` - so this is a
modelling choice and not a constraint. One disclosure: every `_` in the spec
corpus sits in a post-`~` segment, the way a component instance's own segment
does here; `_` in the first absolute segment is legal and unprecedented.

**3. Instance and props schema are ONE document.** The objection recorded
here before - that merging them would create a third, poorer-fit artifact -
was an argument against merging a DERIVED SCHEMA with a plain record. There is
no derivation left to merge: a component is a well-known instance of the
component type, so the record IS the component and the props schema is a part
of it. One document carries the identity, the meaning, the extraction's own
readings and the props surface; the props surface has no identifier inside it,
and `liftPropsSchema` stamps its type id and schema dialect back on for the
readers that need it as a schema. The reader the split was defended for - a
catalog or a lint with no JSON Schema machinery - reads the same path it read
before and now finds `forwards_to` and the metamodel version in the same file
as everything else, rather than split across two.

**4. The x-gts-traits hybrid is implemented; what ADR 0005's answer changes.**
See "The x-gts-traits hybrid" section above for the split itself and the two
gts-ts mechanics it had to work around. `ADR/0005-default-type-substrate-provider.md`
decides which component owns the default GTS-backed type-substrate provider -
it does not answer, and was never meant to answer, whether a GTS runtime
ever reads a component's traits to CHANGE behavior at runtime versus only
validating and storing them. That question is still open: it was put to the
harness reviewer in the same review thread and is unanswered as of this
pilot. Two outcomes, both already accounted for
by `SEMANTIC_FIELD_TARGETS` being the single routing switch: if the answer
is "validate-and-store" (traits are checked and carried, nothing reads them
to change behavior), nothing here changes - that is what this hybrid already
assumes. If the answer is "a runtime acts on traits", the documentation
fields currently left in `x-uikit` (`intent`, `typical_uses`, `invariants`,
`anti_patterns`, `examples`) would need to move too, since "a runtime reads
this" becomes the same bar `x-gts-traits` already uses for everything else -
at that point `x-uikit` would fold away and the whole overlay would be
traits, the "move everything" shape the maintainer's original comment
(item 2) proposed.

**5. "Block", not "higher-order component", for future template-copied
composites.** The maintainer's terminology note proposed
naming the future template-copied composite a kit-family root plus its parts
compose into - not shipped anywhere in this branch - a "block" rather than a
"higher-order component": HOC still implies an npm-consumed, versioned
artifact the way Accordion's own root/item/trigger/content family is, where
a block implies something a template copies in and the owning project then
forks and maintains itself, per DESIGN's own library-vs-template line (the
same distinction the upstream component registry draws between its library
components and its block templates). Adopted as the term for whoever picks up block/template
composite work next; no code in this branch defines, ships or tests a
block - Accordion and DataTable are both ordinary (if compound, in
Accordion's case) kit components, not blocks.

## An empty property schema is not a neutral statement

**Observed.** An agent-facing evaluation pointed an agent at the accordion
root's forwarded surface and asked what `Accordion`'s `value` and
`defaultValue` accept. It answered "plain strings." The real type is
`AccordionValue<Value>` - an array of the root's own generic parameter.
Nothing said otherwise: `value`, `defaultValue` and `onValueChange` were each
the literal `{}`, because `classifyProviderSafeType` returned `undefined` for
them and the compiler had nowhere to put the fact it had already read. `{}` in
JSON Schema means "no assertion", and a reader with no other source of truth
reads that as "anything, so probably the obvious thing."

Where those three props LIVE was the second half of the same finding, and it
is answered separately - see "A prop of the primitive is the component's API"
at the top of this file. This section is about the writing.

The gap was only ever in the WRITING. The extractor had the checker's
printed type text for every prop, own and inherited, and had had it since
the harness was built - `ExtractedProp.typeText`, already normalized by
`normalizeImportPathsInTypeText` (DataTable's forced change 4) so it carries
no machine-specific path. The own-props side had also already solved the
same problem: a slot property gets `Slot: <type>. No JSON Schema type exists
for it; ...`. That wording simply never covered the inherited side, where
the untypeable props are far more numerous - 182 of the accordion
root's forwarded props (every event handler, `style`, `children`,
`contentEditable`, `role`) were `{}`.

**Changed.** `describeUntypeableProperty` (compile.ts): a property schema
carrying none of `type`, `enum`, `const`, `$ref`, `anyOf`, `oneOf` and no
description of its own gets
`TS: <type text>. Not expressible in JSON Schema, checked by tsc.` Applied to
every API prop and as a post-condition on every declared one, where it is
deliberately a no-op - the slot branch already writes a more specific
description and a typed property already asserts something - so that the rule
holds for whatever branch is added next rather than being restated per branch.
The slot wording is untouched, and the hand-written element surfaces carry the
same wording for the two React attributes no JSON Schema type covers (`style`,
`children`).

**Decisions taken along the way.**

- **The type text carries no module specifier.** The checker would print
  `import("@base-ui/react/accordion/index").AccordionValue<Value> | undefined`;
  the committed text is the bare `AccordionValue<Value> | undefined`. The
  qualifier names a foreign package's internal file layout, which is not how
  anything imports that type and not part of what the type is CALLED, and it
  is the printer's fallback rather than a fact about the prop. See "What a
  name is not evidence of" at the end of this file for why that stopped
  being a cosmetic question.
- **A description is not a compatibility signal.** `diffPassthroughSchema`
  and `diffOwnPropsSchema` read `type`, `enum`, `required` and property
  presence, and never `description`; gts-ts's own `checkCompatibility` was
  asserted to agree rather than assumed to (see check-lib.compat-e2e.test.ts).
  This matters in both directions: adding prose to a property must not
  refuse a recompile, and the neighbouring case - an unconstrained property
  gaining a real `type` - must stay incompatible, which it does.
- **A new fixture rather than a reused one.** No existing fixture had an
  untypeable OWN prop; `untypeable-props.fixture.tsx` carries a generic
  `Value[]`, a function prop and a plain `string` in one props type, so the
  test can tell "describe what cannot be asserted" apart from "describe
  everything".

**Cost.** Under an hour. The fix is small because the fact was already
extracted; what took the time was confirming the compatibility path treats
prose as prose, since a wrong answer there would have made every existing
contract refuse its own recompile.

## Compiler coupling: the libraries the classifier knows

`extract.ts`'s `classifyDeclarationSite` files a prop the kit does not declare by the package that declares it, read off the already-relativized declaration path. A package in `PRIMITIVE_LIBRARY_PREFIXES` (the primitive library the kit builds on, and a second laid out the same way) or in `WRAPPED_LIBRARY_PREFIXES` (the third-party libraries whose components the kit re-exposes) declares the component's API. React's own DOM attribute types declare the surface it forwards. A prop from any other package is filed in `unclassifiedProps`, and `compileContract` refuses the component naming those props and their declaration files: the compiler cannot tell that package's API from what it forwards, and either guess would be a fact the contract states without knowing it.

The element side reads the host element from the first place the heritage walk finds one: the tag argument of an element helper (React's `ComponentProps<'tag'>`, the primitive libraries' props helpers), the one tag a multi-tag primitive part documents itself as rendering, or the DOM interface an attribute type names (`*HTMLAttributes<X>`, `DetailedHTMLProps<A, X>`) through `DOM_INTERFACE_TAGS`, which maps only interfaces that stand for one tag. With forwarded DOM props and no element, `compileContract` refuses, naming every heritage node the walk could not read, because there is no honest surface to declare them in.

Adding a library is three things: its prefix in one of the two lists, a `classifyHeritageReference` shape for its props helper when it has one (the same symbol and declaration-file check every other shape uses, never identifier text), and a hand-written surface for any element kind the kit did not already render. Which list a library belongs in, and whether its props are a part's API at all, is a decision about that library, not a config toggle.

## "Not a component of this kit" is an answer the metamodel had no way to give

**Observed.** An agent-facing evaluation pointed two agents at
`button.contract.yaml`'s navigation rule. `dont_use_when[].instead` was typed
as a component type reference and nothing else, so a rule whose honest answer
is "this kit ships no Link component" could only be satisfied by naming the
nearest kit component - `navigation_menu`, with an author comment in the YAML
admitting it was a stand-in. Both agents opened NavigationMenu, judged it far
too heavy for a single link, and fell back to a plain anchor on their own. A
weaker agent would have shipped NavigationMenu for one link; a validator
resolving `instead` finds a component the kit really ships and calls the
contract correct. `button.md` had said the honest thing all along ("for plain
navigation use the consumer app's link component"), so the contract and the
prose disagreed on the one component the contract format was piloted on.

The comment was the tell. An overlay field whose author has to write "this is
a stand-in" next to a value is a field whose vocabulary cannot express the
fact being recorded - and the comment is not in the compiled artifact, so the
only reader who ever saw the caveat was the next person to open the YAML.

**Changed.** `dont_use_when[].instead` is now a `oneOf`: the component type
reference exactly as before, or `{ external, note? }` - `external` required
and non-empty (what to use, outside this kit), `note` optional (why no kit
component fits), `additionalProperties: false`. Button's navigation rule
takes the external form and points at the consumer app's link component,
with the note carrying what `button.md` documents: an action that must read
as a button while navigating stays on Button over a real anchor
(`render={<a href="..." />}` with `nativeButton={false}`). No other overlay
needed the new form - accordion's and data-table's alternatives (Collapsible,
Tabs, Card, Button, Table) are all components the kit ships, checked rather
than assumed.

**Decisions taken along the way.**

- **An object, not a second string convention.** A prefix or sentinel string
  (`external:...`) in the same slot would keep one type and cost every reader
  a parse before it could tell a resolvable ref from prose - the ambiguity
  that made the stand-in readable as a recommendation in the first place. A
  distinct JSON shape is what makes "resolve this" and "do not try" a
  structural question: `isExternalAlternative` (compile.ts) is a `typeof`
  check, and every ref-resolving reader - the per-component conformance
  suites today, a registry check later - skips the external form instead of
  failing a grammar check on it.
- **`note` optional, `external` required.** A reason with no next move is the
  same gap a "don't" without an "instead" leaves, one level down; a pointer
  with no reason is often complete on its own.
- **The metamodel vocabulary is at `2.0.0`.** Nothing outside this repository
  reads the metamodel and the described set is three directories, so the
  version an instance carries states which vocabulary it was compiled
  against, not a compatibility promise to anyone. The metamodel's own type id
  (`...meta.component.v1`) is a separate axis: it versions the TYPE, not the
  field vocabulary.

**Cost.** Under two hours, most of it in the places the widened type
propagates rather than in the schema change itself: the trait schema (free -
`buildGtsTraitsSchema` takes whatever `buildMetamodel` states for a field, so
the object form validates in `x-gts-traits` with no edit) and the two
conformance suites that resolve references, which skip what is not one.


## The overlay vocabulary as GTS types

**Observed.** The base component type carried its whole validator-read
vocabulary inline: 296 lines in which a `don't` rule, a composition, a
coverage claim, a family membership and an extension point were anonymous
objects nested inside one schema, and a reference to another kit component
was a string with a `pattern` and a comment saying a real reference would go
here. Two consequences, both real rather than stylistic: nothing outside that
one file could name a concept the overlay is made of, and the metamodel had
to restate the same definitions locally, kept in step only because
`buildGtsTraitsSchema` copied them through an inliner.

**Changed.** Twelve types, one concept each, under a `trait` namespace: six
that are a field of the validator-read block (`dont_use_when_rule`,
`composition`, `deprecations`, `coverage`, `family`, `extension_point`) and
six the first six embed (`external_alternative`, `child_composition`,
`parent_composition`, `prop_deprecation`, `coverage_assumption`,
`coverage_verdict`). They are committed under `scripts/contracts/types/`,
written from their builders by `npm run contracts:compile -- --schemas`
together with the base type and the metamodel, and diffed against a fresh
build by the freshness comparison on every described component's run. The
base type's trait schema and the metamodel both reach a concept by reference,
so a definition exists once. A reference to a component is now that
component's own derived props-schema id
(`gts.frontx.uikit.base.component.v1~frontx.uikit.component.<name>.v1~`),
because that is the type a component IS - there is no second identifier
standing for the same thing - and it carries `x-gts-ref` naming what it must
resolve to.

**Why.** A type system's value is that a concept has one definition and an
identity anything can point at. An inline object has neither: it cannot be
referenced, cannot be validated on its own, and the second copy of it drifts
the moment someone edits one of the two. `inlineLocalRefs` existed only to
carry copies past a resolver that wanted references all along, and is gone.

**What `x-gts-ref` does and does not do here.** Inside
`x-gts-traits-schema`, `x-gts-ref` is an annotation and nothing more:
`GtsStore.normalizeSchema` strips it before any validator sees the schema,
and then drops any `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf` branch that was left with nothing
else in it. A branch written the way the ecosystem's MFE schemas write one -
`{ "x-gts-ref": "..." }` alone - therefore disappears, and `instead` silently
stops accepting component ids at all. Every id-valued field consequently
carries `type` and `pattern` alongside the reference: the reference states
what the value must resolve to, the pattern is what rejects a malformed one.
Resolution against the registry happens where gts-ts actually runs its
reference validator, on the instance path
(`GtsStore.validateInstance` -> `XGtsRefValidator`), and only for a property
carrying `x-gts-ref` directly: the instance's `props` is checked that
way and fails when the contract it names is not registered. A reference
nested inside a referenced vocabulary type - a `don't` alternative, a
composition kind, a family member - is not reached by that walk, so those
stay resolved by the conformance suites, which also answer a question the
registry cannot: most components a `don't` rule points at ship no contract
yet, and "the kit ships this component" is a directory, not a registration.


## Five ways the checks printed PASS on a change a consumer would feel

**Observed.** A review of `runCompat` and `runGuard` found five paths where the
harness reported success on a change it exists to catch. Each was reproduced
before it was fixed.

- **The forwarded surface could be dropped whole.** The passthrough reference
  was read off the NEW contract only. A contract that stops composing its
  passthrough type has nothing to look up, so the entire forwarded-surface
  block was skipped and the comparison reported "backward compatible" while
  every forwarded prop disappeared.
- **A deleted contract was never compared.** The comparison walks the contract
  units on disk and asks each one what it used to be. A contract that exists
  only at the base reference is walked by nobody, so a deletion - and a rename
  whose two halves neither git's rename detection nor the `$id` nor the stem
  could pair up - was not passed so much as never looked at.
- **The coverage allowlist was outside its own gate.** `covered.json` sat in
  the set of files excluded from the guard's widening, so editing it widened
  nothing: an entry could be added for a directory that does not exist, or
  left behind for one that was deleted, and nothing checked it until some
  unrelated change happened to touch that directory. The coverage report
  counted such an entry as coverage.
- **A change of forwarded surface failed nothing.** When a component was
  re-based onto a different primitive, the base reference had no file for the
  new key, so the comparison reported the signal as skipped and let the change
  through - including when props disappeared across the move. Both files were
  available the whole time, under two different names. The same rule now
  applies to a change of HOST ELEMENT, which is what a re-base changes about
  the forwarded surface once the surfaces are per-element and hand-written.
- **A base reference that does not resolve.** Reported by the reviewer as
  passing silently; measured, it was louder than that - `git diff
  base...HEAD` fails, so the run died with Node's whole spawn record around a
  one-line `fatal:`. Two lookups did swallow it, though (`ls-tree` for the
  base-ref contract list and for the generated types), and with the removal
  sweep above added, an empty contract list means "nothing was removed" as
  well as "nothing to match against" - a swallowed failure that would now be
  a wrong verdict rather than a missing hint.

**Changed.** The passthrough reference is read from both revisions and the two
answers decide the comparison: nothing when neither forwards; nothing to
report when only the current revision does, an arriving surface being the
widening direction; the shape comparison otherwise, against the empty surface
when the current revision forwards nothing and with the move named when the
host element changed. A skipped note is kept for what genuinely cannot be
compared and for nothing else. (Written against the origin-keyed generated
files; it reads the host element now, and the shape comparison covers a move
because two hand-written element surfaces share their common attributes by
construction rather than by two derivations agreeing.) Every base-reference contract no committed contract claimed
is swept up as a removal, refused while `covered.json` still names its
component and accepted, named, once it does not - the same acknowledgement the
guard already demands of a removed directory, so the two rules are one rule.
`covered.json` gets its own widening signal, distinct from the compile-path
one and printed as its own reason. Both subcommands verify the base reference
with `git rev-parse --verify <base>^{commit}` before doing anything, and every
git call whose failure is not itself an answer now raises a one-line error
naming the command instead of returning an empty list.

**Cost and coverage.** The decision rules stay in `check-lib.ts` as pure
functions. What moved is the shell: `check.ts` now names its impurities in a
`CheckContext` - the repository root, the overlay listing, the export listing,
the freshness comparison, where it logs - and `runCompat`/`runGuard`/
`runCoverage` return an exit code rather than calling `process.exit`. That is
what makes `check.e2e.test.ts` possible: twelve cases, each building a real
git repository in a temp directory with a fixed author and no global git
config, driving the real entry points over it. Every one of the five was
confirmed to print PASS, or to print a Node stack dump, before the fix.

**What is still not checked.** The e2e suite injects the compile-and-diff path
rather than compiling real TypeScript in the fixture repo - those three
functions resolve paths against this package and can only ever answer about
this package. The compile path is asserted for real by each described
component's own contract suite; what the fixture repo tests is everything the
harness says about a repository.


## The coverage report's 126 TypeScript programs

**Observed.** The contract step took 105s in CI, 92% of it `contracts:coverage`
(96.4s). That command fails no build by design: it walks 63 component
directories and prints how many are described. It was building two
`ts.Program`s per directory - one in `extractComponent` for the component
names, one in `listExportedDeclarationNames` for every exported name - 126
programs for 63 directories, sharing nothing. A program is not a parse of one
file: it is the parse, bind and module resolution of that file and its whole
transitive closure, and the kit's 63 components share nearly all of theirs.
Measured over the same entry files: 126 programs 33.5s, 63 programs 16.0s, one
program over all 63 roots 0.73s.

**The result the obvious fix would have changed.** One shared program for
every extraction is not a free substitution, and the freshness comparison said
so immediately: with all 63 components in one program, `button` and both
accordion parts reported their committed forwarded surfaces as stale (at the
time those were derived per component; the same instability would now show up
in the API props' own type text). Two things `checker.typeToString` prints are
properties of the whole compilation rather than of the file:

- the module specifier inside an `import("...")` type - the same Base UI event
  type prints as `import("@base-ui/react/types/index")` out of a one-root
  program and `import("@base-ui/react/index")` out of a 63-root one, the
  specifier being chosen from the modules the program can already reach;
- the ORDER of a union's members, which follows internal type ids and so
  follows the order the program bound its files: `"none" | "off" | "on" | ...`
  became `"off" | "none" | "on" | ...`.

Both land in a compiled contract, in the prose a property with no schema shape
carries. Sharing a program for extraction would have made a component's
committed artifacts depend on which OTHER components happened to be in the
same run - and on which subcommand ran, since the guard's root set is its
change set. That is exactly the machine-independence the prop sort (N3) and
the import-path normalization already exist to protect.

**Changed.** The split is by what an answer is used for, not by what is
convenient. Extraction that produces an artifact keeps its own program over
its own file. The two questions whose answers are only counted are moved off
that path: `listExportedDeclarationNames` builds no program at all - every
answer it gives is read off the syntax tree, so 63 programs' worth of module
resolution was being spent on a question no checker was ever asked - and a new
`listComponentExportNames` answers "which of these files' exports are
components" for every file in one program, behind its own cache so that an
extraction taken from it can never reach `compileContract`. The caller
declares its root set (`CheckContext.prepareExtraction`), because there is no
one right answer to it: a kit-wide report wants all 63 in one program, a
single-component compile wants one file.

126 programs became one.

**Numbers**, local, warm, best of two:

| Command | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run contracts:coverage` | 38.3s | 6.8s |
| `npm run policy:contracts` (guard + compat + coverage vs `origin/develop`) | 47.5s | 11.9s |
| `extract.test.ts` | 5.1s | 5.1s |

**Identity.** Every described component was recompiled and every shared schema
rebuilt: no artifact changed. The coverage report's own JSON is identical
field for field across all 63 directories, including the per-directory export
counts and the skipped-export lists.

**Not done: one shared program for `extract.test.ts`'s fixtures.** It is the
slowest test file in the package (55s in CI) and its 16 fixtures would share
one program the same way. Left alone deliberately: the measurement above shows
the program shape moves `typeText`, and one of that file's assertions reads a
union's member order out of it. Putting the extractor's own suite on a program
shape no real run uses would point the one test that could catch a `typeText`
regression at the wrong compilation. The file is unchanged and still builds a
program per fixture.

## The compatibility gate had an escape hatch nobody could take

**Observed.** A second review of the harness found the gate's own arithmetic
wrong in two directions at once.

The escape hatch was kit-wide. Every identifier builder read one constant, so
"move the major and the narrowing is accepted" meant rewriting the identifier
of every contract, every instance and every reference in the kit - for one
component's narrowing. A gate whose only acknowledgement costs that much is
one people route around.

And the gate under-reported and over-reported at the same time. The declared
props diff read removals and newly-required props and nothing else, so a plain
`string` prop becoming a literal union passed - measured against the installed
type system, its own backward check does not report an enum appearing over an
existing type either, though it does report one appearing where the property
asserted nothing at all. Meanwhile a prop that left `properties` and was still
accepted by the element surface the contract forwards to - a component dropping
its own narrower `className` declaration - was reported as a breaking removal
and demanded a major move for a change no consumer can feel.

**Changed.** The major comes from the component's own overlay (`major:`,
default 1) and is threaded through the three identifier builders; a reference
carries the TARGET's major, read from the target's overlay, so moving one
component's major moves that component's identifiers and the references to it,
and nothing else. The shape rule that the forwarded surface already had is now
one function over both halves of a contract. And a declared prop that left
`properties` is reconciled against the forwarded surface: declared there under
the same name, it is reported as moved rather than removed, with the two
shapes compared. A name that surface admits only through a pattern family is a
removal - the family admits a shape of name, and nothing behind it is the prop
that left.

**Decisions taken along the way.**

- **The major is declared on the overlay schema, not on the metamodel.** It is
  not a field of a contract instance - it is part of every identifier the
  instance carries - so declaring it in both places would be one fact written
  twice with nothing keeping the two in step. Nothing in the compiled output
  changed when it moved: every overlay omits it, and every contract still
  carries major 1.
- **What the type system does and does not catch is pinned, not assumed.** Five
  cases in `check-lib.compat-e2e.test.ts` measure its backward verdict
  directly, including the two it reports and the three it does not. Each is a
  reason `diffOwnPropsSchema` exists, and a version that starts or stops
  reporting one fails that suite instead of quietly changing how much the gate
  catches.

## Four ways the guard's scope was narrower than the thing it guards

**Observed.** The same review found the guard in scope for less than it
protects, and one of the gaps was outside the package entirely.

- A committed contract carries the checker's printed type text for every
  property no schema shape can express - the primitive library's
  `AccordionValue<Value>`, React's `CSSProperties`. A dependency bump reshapes
  every described component's artifacts with no file under `src/components` or
  `scripts/contracts` touched, and the lockfile that decides which version is
  installed is not even visible to the package-relative change set the guard
  collects.
- Dropping a component from the coverage allowlist took it out of scope with no
  line in any output - and that same edit is the acknowledgement the removal
  sweep accepts, so the one edit that ends a component's coverage was the one
  edit nothing looked at.
- A covered component with no `*.contract.test.ts` was held to the freshness
  comparison in continuous integration only. The comparison is asserted twice
  on purpose, and the second assertion - the unit run of whoever changed the
  component - simply did not exist for such a directory.
- The exclusion set naming files that do NOT widen the scope named
  `check-lib.test.ts`, which the `.test.ts` rule already excluded. An
  unreachable entry there reads as a decision somebody took about that file.

**Changed.** Two more widening reasons, each with its own signal in the
guard's output so a reader knows which applied: a dependency manifest (the
package's own `package.json` and the repository's lockfile, read from a
repository-scoped change set added for exactly this), and the union of the
allowlist as it is with the allowlist as it was at the base reference. A
component the allowlist has dropped gets its own verdict - reported, not
failed, because de-listing is legitimate - and a covered component without a
conformance suite fails. The unreachable exclusion entry is gone.

**Decisions taken along the way.**

- **Both dependency files, not one.** The package's manifest says which version
  range is asked for and the lockfile says which version is installed; a bump
  can move either alone - a range widened without reinstalling, a lockfile
  refreshed inside an unchanged range - and both change what the checker
  prints.
- **De-listing reports rather than fails.** It has to stay possible: it is the
  only acknowledgement this harness records for a removed contract. What it
  must not be is silent.

## Two more places a fact was read from the wrong side

**Observed.** Two smaller findings from the same review, both the same shape -
a lookup that answered from one side of a set when it needed both.

The freshness comparison iterated the vocabulary BUILDER's output, so a
committed `types/*.json` the builder no longer produces was diffed by nobody
while `loadTraitTypes` went on registering it in every GTS store and every Ajv
instance: a definition the harness applies and no comparison covers.

And component-reference resolution took the FIRST component directory whose
name the identifier's stem extends. A part's stem extends its directory's name
by construction, so more than one directory can be a candidate -
`data-table-sort-button` is extended from `data-table` and would be from a
`data` alongside it - and the first one the directory listing happened to yield
would resolve a part into the wrong component in silence.

**Changed.** The freshness comparison is driven from the union of both sides,
and an orphaned type file reads as missing from the fresh compile, which is
what it is. Reference resolution takes the longest directory the stem extends
and fails by name when two of the same length could claim it.

## The builders were pure and re-run anyway

**Observed.** The metamodel, the base type and the vocabulary types are built
by pure string construction, and the vocabulary is read from thirteen files -
and all of it happened again on every validation. One covered component's
compile rebuilt the metamodel several times and re-read the whole vocabulary
directory with it; a widened guard multiplies that by the covered set. The Ajv
instance that validates an overlay was compiled per overlay for the same
reason.

**Changed.** Every builder and loader is memoized for the life of the process,
and the two validators every compile runs - the metamodel against an instance,
the trait schema against a contract's validator-read block - are compiled once.

**Decisions taken along the way.**

- **Memoized through a serialization, not by sharing the object.** Two of the
  readers mutate what they are given: a GTS store normalizes a registered
  schema in place, and Ajv keeps state against one. A structured copy of a
  small document is far cheaper than the construction and the file reads it
  replaces, and it keeps the guarantee every caller already relied on - what it
  gets is its own. `registerContractTypes` dropped its own defensive copy
  because of it.

**Numbers**, local, warm, best of two:

| Command | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `contracts:check -- guard --base HEAD` | 3.91s | 3.14s |
| `npm run policy:contracts` (guard + compat + coverage vs `HEAD`) | 12.31s | 11.54s |

The guard is where the saving is. The policy wrapper's remaining time is
almost entirely the coverage report's single TypeScript program over all 63
component entry files, which no amount of schema caching touches.


## A contract had two parents, and the second one was not a parent

**Observed.** A component contract composed both of its parents through
`allOf`: the abstract base component type first, then the hand-written surface
of the host element it renders. Read as a type model, that says a Button IS
an abstract kit component AND IS React's `<button>` attribute set - multiple
inheritance, and the surface is the wrong side of it. The base type is what a
contract's chained id derives from
(`gts.frontx.uikit.base.component.v1~frontx.uikit.component.button.v1~` names
one parent); the surface is a hand-written set shared kit-wide by every
component that renders the same element, which is a thing a component USES,
not a second thing it is. The type-system maintainer's review of that line:
"I would avoid multiple inheritance at all cost. Composition is more suitable
here."

The merge was also buying less than it looked like. A forwarded attribute
already passes through the derived type's openness - `unevaluatedProperties`
carries the annotated open schema `{ "x-uikit-classification": "unchecked" }`, so a
prop nothing evaluates is admitted and reported rather than rejected - not
through the second `allOf` branch. What the branch did add was the surface's
own assertions on the attributes it types (`type` on a `<button>` is one of
three values), and those are assertions a validator can apply from a reference
just as well as from a merge.

**Changed.** A contract derives from exactly one type. `allOf` carries the
base type and nothing else, and the surface is a value the contract names:
`x-gts-traits.host_element`, the surface's GTS id, bare. The instance carries
the same reference beside `props`. Every surface-aware check reads it
through one reader (`hostElementRef`/`hostElementToken`/`loadHostSurface` in
`compile.ts`) instead of walking the schema body: the compatibility check's
element-surface comparison for both revisions, the coverage report's line of
forwarded props no surface declares, the conformance assertions that the
reference resolves to a committed file and that no committed surface is named
by nothing. Props validation composes at the point of use -
`compilePropsValidator` resolves the reference and applies the surface beside
the contract - so the assertions the merge used to contribute are still made,
by the reader that asked for them rather than by the artifact.

**Where the reference lives, and why there.** In `x-gts-traits`, not as a
top-level `x-uikit-host` annotation. `x-gts-traits` is the block
`GTS.validateEntity` checks against the abstract type's
`x-gts-traits-schema`; `x-uikit` carries what the extraction read out of the
source, which no validator checks. The host element is read by four checks, so
it belongs in the block that is checked - and its shape is then declared once,
beside every other field of that block. On the instance it is a top-level field
beside `props`, which makes it the second reference gts-ts resolves
against the registry itself: `XGtsRefValidator` walks instance properties, so
an instance naming a surface no committed file declares now fails by name,
which the `allOf` `$ref` never did on the trait path.

The value is spelled the way every other reference here is: a string with
`type` and `pattern` beside `x-gts-ref`, because `GtsStore.normalizeSchema`
strips `x-gts-ref` before any validator sees the schema and would drop a
branch left with nothing else in it. `x-gts-ref` states what the value must
resolve to (`gts.frontx.uikit.element.*`), the pattern is what rejects a
malformed one.

**What the compiler owns.** `host_element` is the one trait field an overlay
may not write - which element a component renders is a fact of its source -
so it is listed as compiler-written (`COMPILER_WRITTEN_TRAITS`), removed from
the overlay schema, and nullable in the schema the abstract type carries for
the same reason a family membership is: `GtsStore.validateSchemaTraits` demands a value or a default for every
declared property, and DataTable renders its Table internally and names no
surface at all.

## The vocabulary described the harness, not the component

**Observed.** The type-system maintainer's review of the overlay vocabulary
read it as a reader would and found the words pointing at the tooling rather
than at the component. A "don't" carried an `instead` that was either a GTS id
or an object with an `external` key - two shapes for one recommendation, and
the object form named the case by what the KIT lacks rather than by what the
reader should do. `composition` bundled three things a reader asks separately:
what may nest inside, where the component may be mounted, and how icons get
in. `coverage` mixed one-word claims with a list of `assumptions` whose `kind`
was doing the work the field name should have done, and the word itself
collided with test coverage. `extension_points` folded a prop, a helper export
and a feature set behind one `kind` enum, so a reader had to filter a list to
learn any one of the three. `passthrough` named a mechanism (props pass
through) where the concept is a thing (the attribute surface of a host
element); `trait` named the carrier (`x-gts-traits`) rather than the content;
`covered.json` and its report shared a word with the coverage tools. And one
word, "verdict", was doing three unrelated jobs: the answer to a
self-assessment claim, the classification of a prop nothing evaluates, and the
result of a compatibility comparison.

Worse than any single word: every meaning field was emitted TWICE, into the
contract's annotation blocks and again as top-level fields of the metamodel
instance, with nothing but the compiler keeping the two copies equal.

**Changed.** Name the domain concept, put the tooling concern in an attribute:
one word per concept, one concept per word. The retired names and their
current ones:

| Then | Now |
|------|-----|
| `gts.frontx.uikit.trait.<x>.v1~`, `types/trait.<x>.v1.json` | `gts.frontx.uikit.vocabulary.<x>.v1~`, `vocabulary/<x>.v1.json` |
| `gts.frontx.uikit.passthrough.dom_button.v1~`, `passthrough/` | `gts.frontx.uikit.element.dom_button.v1~`, `elements/` |
| `dont_use_when[].rule` | `dont_use_when[].situation` |
| `dont_use_when[].instead` as an id or an `external_alternative` | `instead` as a `recommendation` (`target`, optional `component`, optional `note`) |
| `composition.children.kinds` (refs, `text`, `none`) | `accepts` (`content`, `components`, `text`) |
| `composition.children.icons_via` | `accepts.icons_via` |
| `composition.mounts_in` plus the derived `composition.parent.kinds` | `mounted_in`, one field, one shape - filled entries carrying a kit component reference beside authored ones carrying a note |
| `family` (`root` ref, `role`, `parts`) | `family_membership` (`name` token, `role`, filled `members`) |
| `coverage.<claim>: verified \| checked-no \| not-described` | `attestations.<claim>: { outcome: verified \| failed \| unknown, by? }` |
| `coverage.assumptions[]` with `kind`, then `untyped[]` with `about` | `prop_statements`, a map keyed on the property (`states`, `because`), plus `unexposed_parts`, `mounted_in` and `invariants` for the rest |
| assumption kinds `untyped_prop`, `hidden_part`, `external_mount`; `about` values `prop`, `unexposed_part`, `outside_mount` | a `prop_statements` key, an `unexposed_parts` entry, an authored `mounted_in` entry |
| `extension_points[]` with `kind: prop \| helper \| feature` | `slots[]`, `companions[]`, `capabilities[]` |
| `hidden[]` | `withheld[]` |
| `x-uikit.slots`, the machine's own per-property record | `x-uikit.partially_typed_props` |
| `Slot: <type>.` as the emitted prefix on such a property | `Partially typed: <type>.` |
| `props_schema`, the document's props surface | `props` |
| `props`, the authored statement map | `prop_statements` |
| meaning fields emitted into the contract's `x-gts-traits` | meaning fields as top-level properties of the instance, checked by the component type |
| `x-uikit-verdict: unchecked` | `x-uikit-classification: unchecked` (the key, not the value) |
| `covered.json`, "coverage report" | `enrolled.json`, "enrollment report" |
| `CompatVerdict.status` | `CompatDecision.decision` |
| titles "UiKit button contract", "UiKit component contract metamodel" | "UiKit Button", "UiKit component metamodel" |

The three answers a contract gives stay three answers, because they answer
different questions: an attestation carries an OUTCOME, a prop carries a
CLASSIFICATION (`known`, `near_miss`, `unchecked`), a comparison against a base
reference carries a DECISION. Only the shared word went.

**One meaning document.** A contract is one document: a well-known instance
of the component type, carrying its identity, the metamodel version, every
meaning field as an ordinary property, the `x-uikit` block of what the
extraction read, and its props surface. Each meaning field is stated once, and
a validator checks it by name against the type the same way it checks any
instance property.

**No routing map.** There is no per-field target column. A meaning field is
one an author states and it lands on the document; `x-uikit` is written by the
compiler end to end and nothing an author writes reaches it, so the question a
routing map answered does not arise per field. `SEMANTIC_FIELDS` is the list
of what an author may state, and the document's own type is derived from it.
A future field that is neither asserted nor extracted would state where it
belongs where it is defined, beside its own definition.

**What the stress test withdrew.** The same review pushed six changes further
than they went, and each was withdrawn by the maintainer's own stress test of
it: dropping the abstract base type (the namespace slot is mandatory in the
GTS grammar, so the shorter id is not an identifier at all, and "base" is a
reasonable word for that slot); collapsing the three answers into one
epistemic enum (they answer different questions); replacing an untyped
statement's `about` with `expressed_in` (the both-ways pairing checks are
keyed on what a statement is ABOUT, and `expressed_in` carried no load beside
its authoring cost); computing a component's mount points lazily instead of
materializing them (the normative reader holds one contract document with
nothing else loaded); moving deprecations onto the props schema's own
properties; and renaming `host_element`. Recorded because a withdrawn proposal
is the cheapest thing to propose twice.

**Effort.** Three commits: the words, the shapes, the documents. The harness's
guarantees are unchanged - the same checks, the same pairing rules, the same
compatibility signals, the same freshness comparison - and no version moved,
because nothing outside this branch had consumed the previous names.

## What a name is not evidence of

**Observed.** A reviewer's question on the accordion contract - "is it
correct?" against `defaultValue`, a property with no JSON type and only the
compiler's prose - turned up two defects in one line of generated text:

```
TS: import("@base-ui/react/accordion/index").AccordionValue<Value> | undefined.
Not expressible in JSON Schema, checked by tsc.
```

The first is a false claim. `AccordionValue<Value>` is `Value[]` - Base UI's
own alias for an array of item values - and an array is one of the few things
JSON Schema states plainly. `classifyProviderSafeType` matched the PRINTED
TEXT against `boolean`, `string`, `number` and a string-literal union, and an
alias name matches none of those, so a fully checkable list was written down
as unreachable. The reader who concluded `value` took a plain string had, by
then, been told twice: once by an empty schema and once by a sentence saying
no schema could help.

The second is noise standing in for information. `import("@base-ui/react/
accordion/index")` names a file inside somebody else's package - not how that
type is imported, not stable across that package's own refactors, and of no
use to a consumer who wants to know what to pass. `Value`, on the other hand,
is not noise: it is the component's own public generic.

**Changed.** Classification moved from the printed text to the resolved type.
`extract.ts`'s `expressType` walks the checker's `ts.Type` and returns the
schema it supports plus whether that schema is the WHOLE type; `ExtractedProp`
carries the answer beside the text, as a required field so a hand-built prop
cannot state one and not the other. Printing uses
`UseAliasDefinedOutsideCurrentScope` with a strip as the guarantee, and a
conformance assertion refuses any compiled artifact whose text still names a
module.

Four properties across the enrolled set gained a type: the accordion root's
`value` and `defaultValue` (`type: array`), and DataTable's `columns` and
`data` (the same, and still slots).

**Decisions taken along the way.**

- **A type parameter resolves to its CONSTRAINT and never to its default.**
  Every instantiation satisfies the constraint; none is bound by a default the
  caller can override, so `<Value = unknown>` justifies nothing about
  `<Accordion<string>>`. A default the caller did NOT override is applied by
  the type system before the extractor sees the type, which is the only place
  applying one is sound. The same reasoning keeps `Value` and `TData` printed
  as themselves: substituting `unknown` would read as a claim about the
  element type, and it would be false.
- **A partly stated type is a third answer, not a rounding of the other two.**
  `ColumnDef<...>[]` is checkably an array and unstateable beyond that. Rounded
  down to "nothing", the schema throws away the one fact it could enforce;
  rounded up to "everything", the prose disappears and the reader is back to
  guessing at the element. So a property may carry both a `type` and its type
  text, the slot record follows "not stated in full" rather than "asserts
  nothing", and the untyped pairing follows the prose - which is exactly the
  compiler's record of what it could not state.
- **A union with one unexpressible member gets no `type` at all.** Halfway
  through this change `TData`'s constraint (`Record<string, any> | Array<any>`)
  was compiling to `type: "array"`, because the object member classified as
  nothing and the array member survived alone. That schema REJECTS a valid row
  type. A `type` covering some members of a union is not a weaker assertion
  than the union, it is a different and wrong one.
- **Objects with known keys stay unexpressed.** They are expressible in
  principle, and the object types that actually reach a kit prop are
  `CSSProperties` and `ColumnDef`. Inlining a foreign package's field list into
  a committed contract would make the artifact a copy of that package's
  internals, versioned on this branch, wrong on the next release of theirs.
- **The wording had to move too.** "Not expressible in JSON Schema" said of a
  property carrying `type: "array"` is the same species of false claim the
  whole finding is about, so a partly stated type says so instead.

**Cost.** Half a day, most of it deciding how much of a type counts as stated
rather than writing the walk. Two facts the harness already had - the resolved
type and its printed name - had been collapsed into one, and separating them
is what the fix mostly is.

## A symmetry closed on one side, and a shape versus a name

**Observed.** Two reviews landed on the same round: the harness reviewer's
second pass found seven places where a rule was closed on one half of a
symmetry and open on the other, and the type-system maintainer's review found
eight mechanical gaps between what a vocabulary type or the compiler claimed
and what it enforced, plus six places where a rename had fixed the word and
left the shape behind.

**Harness mechanics.** Compatibility read a removed property but not a
removed pattern family - `diffElementSurface` compared `properties` on both
sides and never `patternProperties`, so deleting `^on[A-Z]` from a `<button>`'s
surface dropped roughly 150 event handlers with the diff reporting nothing.
A cva axis reached `properties` without passing the same "one prop, one
shape" check a declared or forwarded prop already went through, so an axis
named `type` on a component rendering a `<button>` compiled cleanly beside the
surface's own three-value enum. The open schema's near-miss classification
had no caller deriving a failure from it - `variannt="ghost"` was rejected by
nothing in the repository except one assertion inside Button's own suite.
`eachOverlay`'s kit-wide walk threw on the first overlay that failed to parse,
so one half-written file for an unenrolled component failed every other
component's compile, and it re-walked the whole directory on every call
despite every other builder here being memoized. `isBooleanAxis` counted the
`true`-only shape of a cva boolean variant and not the `false`-only mirror,
which cva resolves to `boolean` exactly the same way. Two comments named a
function that had been renamed out from under them.

**Mechanical gaps.** `family_membership`'s nullable widening depended on
`$ref` staying ahead of a `type` written beside it - gts-ts merges a resolved
reference in at the reference's own position, key order load-bearing for a
value the spec treats as unordered - so every field of that shape now widens
with `anyOf: [{ $ref }, { type: "null" }]` instead. `gts-ts` moved from a
caret range to an exact pin, with the two undocumented behaviours the model
leans on named beside it. `assertOverlayReferencesRealProps` checked six of a
deprecation's seven prop-name-bearing fields and missed `replacement`, which
is exactly the field whose whole job is "point at a prop that still exists".
`attestations` gained a claim registry and a compile-time check, so a typo of
`a11y` fails by name instead of compiling as a well-formed unknown key; `a11y`
and `rtl` became the kit's two required claims. `icons_via` moved inside
`accepted_content`'s own `specified`-only branch. Two grammars used seven
times between them - a component reference, a prop name - became vocabulary
types of their own (`component_reference`, `prop_name`), referenced instead
of repeated; the two places the type system's own reference walk must reach
directly on an instance property (a metamodel instance's `props`, and
`forwards_to` beside it) keep the literal triple, with the reason stated at
the definition rather than left for a reader to reconstruct. `companion.export`
stopped sharing a function with a prop name it was never one. Compat learned
to diff `invariants[].id`: an id present at the base ref and gone now fails
the same way a removed prop does, because an id is a stable handle a lint
finding or an eval can already cite by name.

**Shape versus name.** Six places carried the old shape under a new word, and
each is now the same shape as the sibling that had already been fixed:

- `mount_point` was a `oneOf` split by resolvability (a component-id string,
  or an `outside_mount` object) when `recommendation` next door had already
  made resolvability an optional field instead. It is one shape now -
  `container` required, `component` filled by the compiler, `note` authored
  only where `component` is not - and `outside_mount` is gone. The two facts
  the round left to state ourselves: a filled `container` is the target's own
  export name, and an authored entry carrying `component` still fails the
  compile, refused before the generic "unknown key" a bare schema narrowing
  would have given instead.
- `untyped` was a flat list partitioned by an `about` discriminant, four ways
  the medium fell short rather than four kinds of fact, and two of its
  categories restated a fact a different field already carried. It is
  dissolved: `about: prop` is now `prop_statements`, an overlay map keyed on the
  property itself and emitted by the compiler into that property's own
  description beside the `TS:` text; `about: unexposed_part` is
  `unexposed_parts`, beside `withheld`; `about: behaviour` is an ordinary
  `invariants` entry, because a fact about the component is what an invariant
  is for; `about: outside_mount` is gone outright, because `mounted_in`
  already carries the fact it restated.
- The inline-versus-referenced boundary was "does a validator read it", which
  is a property of the current artifact graph and moves whenever the graph
  does. It is now "is it a scalar, an array of strings, or the one reference
  the type system's own walk must find directly on an instance property" -
  `intent`, `typical_uses` and `forwards_to` stay inline; `invariants`,
  `anti_patterns`, `examples` and `withheld` are now lists of a named
  vocabulary type (`invariant`, `anti_pattern`, `example_pair`,
  `withheld_prop`) instead of anonymous objects a validator merely read the
  shape of.
- `slot` required `typed_by`, the field the whole rework was meant to retire -
  "here is prose naming a type, because the schema could not" - so a slot the
  schema states in full still needed one. `typed_by` is optional now: a slot
  is a prop through which the consumer supplies content, regardless of
  whether that content happens to be typeable. `capability` never had a type
  to name in the first place, by its own description, so it lost `typed_by`
  entirely rather than keeping it optional.
- `anti_pattern.instead` and `dont_use_when_rule.instead` were one word for
  two concepts - fix inside this component, versus use a different one -
  distinguished only by a `$comment` in the source, invisible in a compiled
  contract. The prose one is `do_instead` now; `instead` stays the word for
  the other.
- `host_element` named the element while meaning the surface the component
  forwards to, which is why DataTable correctly declaring none used to read
  as a bug. It is `forwards_to` everywhere the name appeared: the trait
  field, the instance field, the metamodel, `hostElementFor`/`hostElementRef`/
  `hostElementToken` (now `forwardsTo`/`forwardsToRef`/`forwardsToToken`), and
  every description that named it.

**What the stress test withdrew.** Nothing in this round was declined outright.
Two places the shape was left for this pass to decide and are recorded as
decisions rather than findings: a filled `mount_point.container` is the
target's own export name, chosen because that is the string a reader would
already act on; and `attestations`' `unknown` versus an absent key is resolved
by making the kit's two core claims required and defining absence for every
other claim as "not claimed" rather than "considered, not established".

**Effort.** Three commits, same order as the round before: the harness checks,
the mechanical gaps, the shapes. The three real components recompiled through
the harness with no hand-edited JSON; the guarantees the harness gives are the
same guarantees, checked more completely.

## A component is an instance of the component type, not a type derived from one

**Observed.** The base component type carried two halves whose relationship to
a component ran in opposite directions. On the props side, every component's
schema derived from a parent that declared no properties at all, so `Valid(base)`
was "every object" and the one prop all seven contracts share, `className`, was
declared seven times independently. On the meaning side, the same base type
carried an `x-gts-traits-schema` and each contract's `x-gts-traits` block was
checked against it - which is instantiation, not derivation. The type was marked
`x-gts-abstract: true`, normatively "never instantiated": true of the empty half
and false of the half where all the content was. Measured: 0 of 7 contracts
declared an `x-gts-traits-schema` of their own, so the spec's own narrowing rule
was unused, the chain was two deep everywhere, and nothing in the harness read
the chain semantically. Its one live job was letting a reference wildcard-match
"is a kit component", which works on an instance id just as well.

**What the correction removes.** The trait machinery was the source of three
workarounds, all of them now gone rather than relaxed. gts-ts demands a value or
a schema `default` for every property an `x-gts-traits-schema` declares,
regardless of that schema's own `required` list, so nine optional fields carried
`default: null` and eight carried a widened `["...", "null"]` type; one field
that was nothing but a `$ref` needed an `anyOf` wrapper because a `type` written
beside a `$ref` depends on key order when the reference is merged in. All three
were conditions of using traits, not statements about a component. The same is
true of the closure: `validateEntityTraits` REQUIRES `additionalProperties: false`
on every trait schema in the chain, so the closure that would block a second
vendor from adding a field of its own was not a choice the kit could unmake
while it used traits. Off that path it is an ordinary content-model decision,
kept closed for now and reversible in one keyword.

One correction to the argument as it was put: the conditional inside
`accepted_content` was never vacuous - `accepts` is required, so it was live for
all seven components. Only `family_membership`'s conditional was vacuous for a
component that omits the field, and it stays vacuous under plain properties too,
because a property an instance does not carry is not checked either way. The
gain is the deleted wrapper and the deleted defaults, not a conditional switched
back on.

**What it costs.** Every identifier in the kit moves, which is why it was done
now: nothing outside this repository reads these files, so the churn is free
today and never cheaper. The component type is `gts.frontx.uikit._.component.v1~`;
a component is the instance `gts.frontx.uikit._.component.v1~frontx.uikit._.<name>.v<major>`,
and that is also what every reference to a component carries; the props surface
lifted out of a document is `gts.frontx.uikit.props.<name>.v<major>~`, a
standalone type with no parent. Element and vocabulary ids are unchanged.

**One silent failure the move exposed.** `deriveMountPoints` decides whether an
unparseable overlay blocks a compile or merely warns by asking, textually,
whether the file mentions this component - and it built that needle by hand from
a bare segment. Under the new grammar the needle would never have matched: a
hard refusal would have become a `console.warn`, with no output change and
freshness still green. The test covering it could not have caught the drift
either, because it rebuilt the needle from the same expression it asserted on
and built its fixture from that string as well. The needle is now
`componentRefPrefix` in `ids.ts`, imported by both, and the test pins it against
the id a committed contract really carries.

**Effort.** One pass over the harness: `ids.ts` and the component type, the
compiler and the merged document, the conformance suite and the tests, then the
feature spec and these notes. Seven `.contract.instance.json` files and
`base.component.json` are deleted, `buildBaseSchema`, `buildGtsTraitsSchema` and
`nullableGtsTraitsProperty` with them. The genuinely new code is the six-line
lift. The five pinned compatibility verdicts are unchanged, which is the
measurement that mattered: gts-ts's `checkBackwardCompatibility` reads each
schema's raw `properties` and never resolves a chain, so a standalone props type
and a derived one compare identically.

## The compiler version is an input to the freshness gate

The guard fails an enrolled component whose committed artifacts differ from a
fresh compile by so much as a byte, and one of the inputs to that compile is
the TypeScript checker's printed type text - `checker.typeToString` over a
prop's resolved type, which is what a forwarded `style` or a native attribute
union reaches the contract as. That text is the compiler's own rendering, and
it is not stable across compiler versions: a release that prints a union's
members differently, expands an alias the old one kept, or renders an optional
differently moves the bytes without anything in this repository changing.
Sorting every prop list before emit (N3) settles member ORDER, which is a
different question and already answered; the text itself has no such
mitigation and needs none, because the version is pinned. `typescript` is
therefore declared as an exact version in this package, the way `ajv`, `tsx`
and the testing dependencies around it are, and that pin is part of the
freshness contract rather than a tidiness preference: resolve a different 5.x
in this workspace - an update, an install outside the monorepo lockfile, a
future bump - and the guard turns red on a tree nobody touched. The bump is a
deliberate act with its own regenerated artifacts, which is what an exact pin
makes it.

## A component that accepts itself gets no mount point

Mount points are derived by asking every OTHER overlay which components it
accepts inside it, and the walk skips the component's own overlay outright
(`if (stem === exportStem) continue;` in `mountPointsAccepting`). A component
listing itself in its own `accepts.components` therefore yields no mount point
at all, rather than a self-mount saying it nests inside itself. No kit
component does this today, and the ones that could - a tree node, a nested
menu - are not in the described set. The skip is deliberate for now: a
self-mount is a real relationship but a different one from "this container
accepts that part", and what a reader should be handed for it (one entry, or
the depth rule that governs it) is not a question the kit has a case to answer
yet. When one arrives, this is the line to change, and the filled-versus-
authored rule on `mount_point` is what the answer has to fit.

## A sibling kit file's props are the kit's own API

**Observed.** A trigger that reuses the kit button's props type, a menubar part that reuses the dropdown menu's, an input-group input that reuses the kit input's: each was refused, because `className`, `loading` and `icon` were declared in another file of this package, and the classifier's "own" set meant the component's own file only. Eight directories were blocked on nothing else.

**Changed.** The first set is "this package's own source": a declaration in the component's file, or in any other file of the package that is not a dependency, files the prop with the component's own props. The three sets stay three. The nearest declaration is still the one reported, so a prop the component's own file redeclares names that file.

**Decisions taken along the way.** The kit wrote those props, so a consumer reads them as the kit's API, not as a primitive's forwarded surface. The consequence is the one the own set always had: such a prop cannot be withheld (a withheld name may not be one the component declares), and one the schema cannot type gets a partially-typed-props record.

**Cost.** One predicate, and a second `find` beside the first.

## A second primitive library

**Observed.** Two directories wrap a second headless library whose parts are laid out the way the first library's are: a props helper parameterised by the element (`UseRenderComponentProps<'legend'>`), and each part's own API beside React's attributes. Its props were unclassified and its parts resolved no host element.

**Changed.** The classifier takes a list of primitive-library prefixes rather than one prefix, and that library's props helper is recognised as the same heritage shape as the render hook's. Its package identifier appears only as a literal in the prefix list and the helper's declaration check.

**Cost.** Two list entries and one shape check. What "add a primitive library" costs is now stated by what it took: a prefix, and a shape for its props helper.

## One host element among several

**Observed.** A primitive title admits `'h1' | ... | 'h6'` as its element, so no single surface followed from the type and the component was refused.

**Changed.** Where a helper's element argument is a union of tags, the host element is the one tag the file declaring the props type documents its component as rendering ("Renders an `<h2>` element."), read off that file's text, and a note says a caller may render another. With no such tag, or two, the note says the element cannot be read, as before.

**Decisions taken along the way.** The default the primitive documents is what renders when the caller chooses nothing, so it is the element the surface describes; the `render` prop is where a different one comes from, and the overlay's statement for `render` is where that is said to a reader. A union of props types, as opposed to a union of tags, is walked branch by branch, and branches naming different elements are noted with the first kept.

**Cost.** Half an hour; the harder part was deciding that documentation text is evidence here, which it is only because it is the primitive's own and it is read, not guessed.

## Third-party components the kit re-exposes

**Observed.** A chart library, a date picker, a command menu and resizable panels: each wrapper re-exposes the library's own component, so every prop the library declares was unclassified, and the host element was named by DOM interface (`HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>`, `DetailedHTMLProps<..., HTMLDivElement>`) rather than by tag.

**Changed.** Those libraries' props are the wrapper's API and are filed with the primitive libraries' in the middle set, from a second prefix list. React's own attribute interfaces are recognised as a heritage shape whose argument is a DOM interface, mapped to its tag through a table that holds only interfaces standing for one tag; `HTMLElement` and the other shared ones are noted instead. The resolved-type walk recognises an instantiated generic interface as well as an alias, which is how these libraries' types arrive. An alias's props are read from its signature as the alias instantiates it, not as the callable type declares it (`FC<P>`'s `props: P`).

**What could not be read.** The chart legend: the library's own props for it adapt React's event handlers through its own mapped type and name no element anywhere, so 53 forwarded props have no surface. The refusal says so rather than naming only the symptom.

**Cost.** A table, one shape, and an honest refusal message for the one case the types do not answer.

## An export whose name does not extend the directory's

**Observed.** `Toaster` in `toast` and `ScrollBar` in `scroll-area`: the stem from the export's own name is outside the directory's name, so the compiler refused the overlay, and renaming the exports would break the kit's public API.

**Changed.** An overlay may name the export it describes in an `export` field. The stem still extends the directory (`toast-toaster`, `scroll-area-scroll-bar`), which keeps the longest-prefix reference resolution exact; the export name selects the extraction, titles the contract, names a filled mount point's container and is what the near-miss check reads usages of. Absent, the export is the stem in PascalCase, as for every existing contract.

**Cost.** One overlay field and one lookup, used wherever the stem used to be turned into a name.

## A directory that only re-exports a primitive

**Observed.** The direction directory declares nothing: it re-exports the primitive's direction provider. The candidate walk read only function and variable statements, so the directory had no component at all.

**Changed.** A re-exported name with no local declaration is a candidate by the alias rule, read from the symbol it re-exports. The enrollment report's list of exports includes re-exported names, so the hook and the type re-exported beside the provider are shown as not components.

**Decisions taken along the way.** The directory gets a contract because the goal is a described kit, and an agent needs to know the provider exists and what it changes.

**Cost.** One statement form and one shape function.

## A family's root may be mounted elsewhere

**Observed.** A group accepting its members' roots failed the conformance suite: every filled mount point of a family member, the root included, had to lie inside its own family, so the group could not state what it holds.

**Changed.** The rule applies to parts only. It exists so the parts of a compound component are not independently mountable; a root is a component in its own right, so another component's container may hold it. The check is one exported function, tested both ways: a part outside its family still fails, a root inside another component's container passes.

**Cost.** One condition, and moving the check out of the suite body so it can be tested.

## A union props type is read branch by branch

**Observed.** The date picker's props are one union of a single-date and a range branch. The checker's property list for a union holds only what every branch declares, so `numberOfMonths` and the range branch's own props never reached the schema or the near-miss check.

**Changed.** Every branch's props are read. A prop only some branches declare is optional in the contract, and its description says which branches declare it, after the type text where there is one. Where two branches type it differently, the schema states nothing and the printed types of both are what a reader gets. Which descriptions count as a gap is decided by one predicate: prose that opens with the checker's printed type. A branch sentence on a fully typed prop states no gap, so it neither demands a prop statement nor counts as a partially typed prop.

**Decisions taken along the way.** The schema cannot tell the branches apart, so it admits a branch-only prop whichever branch a caller is on; the description is where the narrowing is stated. Adding an optional prop is compatible, so a union reaching the contract this way moves no major.

**Cost.** The enumeration was a small function; the care went into keeping "has a description" and "leaves part of the type to tsc" from meaning the same thing any longer.

## A component's own defaults

A prop's default is the one a caller who passes nothing gets. The extractor reads it from two places: a variant declaration's `defaultVariants`, and the literal defaults the component's body writes into its destructured props parameter (`{ variant = 'outline' }`). A body gives a default two other ways the extractor reads as well, because in both the caller's value wins when given and the literal applies otherwise: a destructured binding with no initializer that every read coalesces to one literal (`variant ?? 'ghost'`), and a literal attribute written on the one element the body returns before the spread of the rest binding or of the whole props parameter (`<Button variant="ghost" {...props} />`), for a prop that is not destructured and reaches the element only through that spread. Every read of the binding counts, a shorthand property (`cva({ variant })`) included, and every return counts: `null`, `undefined` and `false` render nothing and leave the element the only one, while a fragment, a call or a conditional makes it one of several. The component's own returns are the ones counted: a method, a getter or any other nested function returns for itself. A binding read raw as well as coalesced or reassigned in the body (`variant ??= 'solid'`), a mix of literal and computed fallbacks, a spread on an element that is not the one element the body returns - beside another return, under a conditional, or nested inside it - a spread of the rest or the whole props parameter followed by another spread, a rest spread under a conditional, and a prop the body also reads or writes through the rest or the whole props object - `rest.variant = rest.variant ?? 'solid'`, `props.variant ??= 'solid'`, or the object reassigned, handed to a call such as `Object.assign`, or copied - are noted and not stated; a computed fallback alone (`?? inheritedContainer`) is a fallback chain rather than a default and records nothing; an attribute for a forwarded attribute is neither, since the element's surface states no defaults. Where a default and a variant declaration name the same prop, the component's own wins: a wrapper that reuses another component's variant axis and writes its own default for it renders that default, whatever the reused declaration says. The compiler states it as the schema `default` of whichever property it names, an axis, a declared prop or a wrapped library's prop. Literals only - a string, a number, a boolean, null. A computed default is noted in `cannot_extract` and not stated, because nothing a schema holds says what it evaluates to. A default for a prop the contract has no property for, such as an attribute forwarded to the host element, is noted and not stated too: the element's surface states no defaults. A default the property's own schema rejects - `null` for an axis whose enum does not list it, which the variant types admit - fails the compile, since a contract carrying it would state a default no validator of it accepts.

An axis a component removes with Omit, or leaves out with Pick, on the way to a reused variant declaration is not one of its axes: an in-group button that omits the kit button's `size` and declares `size?: 'xs' | 'sm'` has that prop as its own, typed as it declares it, and not the reused axis's values and default.

A default on a property is a compatible addition, so it moves no major.

## A component whose forwarded attributes no element surface describes

A component taken whole from a library can admit React attributes in its type and send them somewhere no element surface describes: the chart legend's type admits the ARIA attributes, and the library passes them to the legend's content renderer as props rather than onto the wrapper it renders, so whether they reach an element at all depends on that renderer. Its type names no element, it has no body of the kit's to read, and naming the wrapper's element would state that the attributes reach it, which they do not.

For that case the overlay may state `host_element: { none: <reason> }`. The compiler admits it only where the source cannot answer: the extraction resolved no element, the component forwards something, and it has no body of its own. The contract then names no element surface and records, among what the extraction could not read, that every attribute it leaves undescribed is described by no element surface, and the stated reason. A component with a body is refused the statement whatever the body returns first - null, a fragment, one of two elements - because the body is where its props go, and it is typed with the helper of the element it spreads them onto instead.

## One statement for a set of properties

A library's legend adapts every React event handler to its own signature, so its props type carries some 160 handlers the schema leaves to tsc, and each states the same fact. The pairing needs every such property explained, and one statement per property would repeat that fact once per handler, some 600 lines no reader gets through.

An overlay therefore has `prop_statement_groups`: entries of `match`, `states` and `because`, where `match` is a regular expression over property names written anchored at the start (`^on[A-Z]`). It shares the syntax of the element surfaces' attribute families but not their anchoring: a group's leading `^` anchors every alternative (`^onClick|Close` is `^(?:onClick|Close)`), while a surface family is read as JSON Schema reads it, where the same text's unanchored `Close` branch matches any name containing it. A pattern copied from one to the other means something else wherever it has a top-level `|`. A group covers a property the schema leaves to tsc, that no `prop_statements` entry names, and that no other group also matches. The rules follow from what a statement is for:

- An explicit statement wins over a group, so a handler with a fact of its own states it without the group's pattern having to exclude it.
- A property the schema leaves to tsc, that no statement of its own names and that two groups match, is covered by neither and is reported once, as that overlap - neither group is also called an orphan for it - because two statements about one property would disagree about what it holds; a pattern that excludes names (`^on(?!(Click|MouseEnter)$)[A-Z]`) keeps two groups apart.
- A group that covers no property is reported, the way a statement about a fully typed property is: it states a fact about nothing in the contract.
- A fully typed property a group's pattern matches is skipped, not refused. A pattern names a shape of name, not a claim about that property, so it states nothing false about one it happens to match, and refusing it would have every group spell out the typed names it must avoid.
- At admission a pattern that does not parse, or matches no prop the component or the primitive declares, is refused, the same way a statement naming an absent prop is.
- The leading `^` anchors every alternative: `^onClick|Close` is read as `^(?:onClick|Close)`, so an alternative cannot match in the middle of a name.
- A group covers every property its pattern matches, including any the library adds later or that only looks like the rest. A callback whose name fits `^on[A-Z]` but is not one of the adapted DOM handlers, such as the legend's `onBBoxUpdate`, would be told the handlers' fact; such a property needs its own statement, which wins, or a pattern that excludes it.

The contract carries each group once, as a field of its own backed by a vocabulary type, and the compiler emits the group's statement into the description of every property it covers, since the description is where a reader of one property looks.

## A surface family the props type admits nothing of

An element surface states the `aria-*`, `data-*` and `on*` families by pattern for every component that renders its element, and a contract naming the surface is read as accepting what the surface admits. A chart content component whose props type omits every DOM event handler, and whose body drops any that arrive, would then be read as accepting `onClick` on its `div`, which the type system rejects.

So the compiler closes, in the contract's own props body, each family of the named surface that no prop the type admits matches: `patternProperties: { "^on[A-Z]": { "not": {} } }`, with a description saying why. Validated beside the surface, the contract then rejects a handler; the classification report counts a name of a closed family as unchecked rather than known; and the compatibility check reads a family closed now but open at the base as a narrowing. A family whose names carry a hyphen is never closed, because the type system admits a hyphenated attribute on any component whatever its props type declares, so `aria-*` and `data-*` stay open; and no family is closed for a props type with a string index signature or a template-literal key, which may accept a name of any family. The rule reads the props type, not the body: a type that admits handlers the body then drops still states that it takes them, and that is a statement for the type to correct.

//    caller's props object still validate" is exactly what
//    `is_backward_compatible` claims to answer, so a newly required prop (or
//    a rename, which looks exactly like a vanished one) is a real backward
//    break the library misses.
//  - an ENUM appearing on a prop that already carried its type is compatible

//    the gap is narrower than "narrowing is unverified" and is closed here
//    with the same rule the forwarded surface already used.)

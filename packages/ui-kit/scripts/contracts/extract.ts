// Contract extraction: the machine-owned half of a component contract.
//
// Reads a component's .tsx through a real ts.Program + TypeChecker (the
// package's own tsconfig.src.json compiler options, so module resolution and
// JSX match the build) instead of pattern-matching syntax. Syntax matching
// missed whatever it did not anticipate - a `type Props = ...` alias instead
// of `interface Props`, a second exported component in the same file, a cva
// config in a sibling module - and missed it silently, which is a worse
// defect than a loud failure: `cannotExtract` exists so a fact the extractor
// could not read shows up in the compiled contract instead of vanishing.
//
// Every property the checker resolves on the component's first parameter is
// filed by WHERE ITS DECLARATION LIVES, into one of three sets:
//
//   - this package's own source                  -> ownProps
//   - a library the component wraps (a primitive
//     library's part, or a third-party library
//     whose component the kit re-exposes)       -> apiProps
//   - React's DOM attribute types               -> forwardedProps
//
// The middle set is the one that matters most to a reader. A prop declared in
// a Base UI part's own props type - Accordion root's `multiple`, Button's
// `render`/`nativeButton` - is not something the kit merely forwards to an
// element: it IS this component's API, wearing the primitive library's
// declaration site as an accident of how the kit wraps that primitive. Filing
// it as forwarded DOM surface is what buried nine accordion-root props in a
// 233-entry generated file nobody read. React's own DOM attributes really are
// forwarded surface, and they are the same surface for every component that
// renders the same host element, which is why they are declared once per
// element kind by hand (see compile.ts's loadElementSurface) instead of
// re-derived per component.
//
// This is what a text-only extractor structurally cannot see: `Omit<X,
// 'className'>` only removes `className` from X's shape, so every other field
// X declares - including ones the component's own source never mentions - is
// still part of the checker-resolved props type.
//
// A property declared in none of the three places is filed nowhere and named
// in `unclassifiedProps`: the compiler refuses such a component rather than
// guessing which side of the API/forwarded line the prop falls on (see the
// coupling note below).

// 126 for 63 components, and spent nearly all of its runtime re-reading the
// same declaration files. Measured over those 63 entry files: 126 programs
// 33.5s, 63 programs 16.0s, one program over all 63 roots 0.73s.
//
// One shared program is NOT, however, a free substitution for the per-file
// programs, and this is the reason the split below exists. What
// checker.typeToString prints is program-global rather than file-local: the
// ORDER of a union's members follows internal type ids and so follows the
// order the program bound its files - `"none" | "off" | ...` became `"off" |
// "none" | ...`. That order lands in a compiled contract, in the prose a
// property whose type no schema shape states in full carries. Sharing a
// program for extraction would therefore make a component's committed
// artifacts depend on which OTHER components happened to be in the same run
// - the exact machine-independence the sort in `extractComponent` (N3) and
// the module-specifier strip above already exist to protect. Measured, not
// assumed: the freshness comparison reports those descriptions as
// differences.
//
// So the split is by what the answer is USED for, not by what is convenient:
// extraction that produces artifacts keeps its own per-file program, and only
// the two questions whose answers are counted rather than written - which
// exports are components, and what every export is called - are allowed to
// share, or to skip a program altogether.

// One extraction per tsxPath for the life of the process - resolveTargetExtraction
// and compileContract each resolve a directory's extraction independently
// (compileContract calls resolveTargetExtraction, and callers routinely call
// resolveTargetExtraction again directly), so a single freshness check for one
// component builds this
// same ts.createProgram several times over for the same source file. That
// program build is several seconds on a CI-class runner, so the redundant
// builds are what pushed the contract test suites past vitest's default
// timeout. Caching by tsxPath is safe here because nothing in this process
// edits the component source between calls - a fresh process (a fresh test
// run, or `contracts:compile` invoked again) starts with an empty cache.

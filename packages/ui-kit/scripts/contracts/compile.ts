//   <out>.contract.json - the component itself, a well-known INSTANCE of the
//                         component type gts.frontx.uikit._.component.v1~,
//                         identified

//
// A component is not a type derived from an abstract component type; it is an
// instance of the component type. The two halves the split artifacts carried
// related to their common parent in opposite directions - the props half
// derived from a parent that declared nothing, while the meaning half was
// checked against that parent as an instance is checked against its type -
// and only one of those was a real relationship. What the component means is
// therefore ordinary property values of this document, checked by the same
// validator that checks any instance against its type, and its props surface
// is a part of the document rather than a second artifact pointing back at it.
//
// The props surface is a STANDALONE type: `props` holds the schema
// body, and the lift (liftPropsSchema below) stamps its own `$id` and schema
// dialect back on at the moment something registers or diffs it, so the
// document carries exactly one identifier at exactly one depth. It does NOT
// close itself: `unevaluatedProperties` carries an annotated open schema
// instead of `false`, so a prop nothing evaluates is admitted and classified
// as unchecked rather than rejected - see OPEN_UNEVALUATED below for why a
// schema is the wrong place to decide that a prop is wrong, and check-lib.ts's
// classifyProps for where the classification is actually reported.
//
// The document NAMES the hand-written surface for the HOST ELEMENT it renders
// (elements/dom_button.json for Button, dom_div.json for Accordion's root),
// which whoever validates props resolves and applies beside the props surface.
// That file is hand-written source - it describes no component's code, so
// there is nothing to extract for it. React's DOM attributes for a given
// element are the same surface for every component that renders it, and a prop
// the primitive library declares for its own part is the component's API
// rather than forwarded surface (extract.ts's declaration-site
// classification), so what is left to generate per component is nothing at all.
//
// What naming the element type buys is a statement of what passes through:
// `className`, `aria-*`, `data-*` and every React event handler are declared
// once, by the element they belong to, so a reader of one contract can tell
// the kit's own API from the DOM surface underneath it without diffing two
// files.
//
// The overlay itself is validated before it is trusted: an unknown key (a
// typo, a stray JSON-schema keyword like `type`/`required`) fails the
// compile by name instead of silently vanishing on merge, and a component
// that redeclares a surface-owned prop with a conflicting type fails
// instead of the element surface quietly winning. A VariantProps heritage
// entry the extractor could not trace to a real cva(...) call fails the same
// way: a component that silently lost its variant axes is a worse defect
// than a compile that stops and says which axis it could not read.
//
// The compiled JSON is the canonical contract every consumer reads (Ajv,
// gtsPlugin.registerSchema, projections, the lint). It is written next to
// the component's own source and committed there, not generated at build
// time - a reviewer sees the compiled shape change in the same diff as the
// source change that caused it, and CI can diff a fresh compile against the
// committed copy to catch a stale contract.

//     abstract component type), which is what makes this a reference rather

//   - `type` and `pattern` stay beside it because gts-ts STRIPS x-gts-ref
//     before any validator sees the schema (GtsStore.normalizeSchema), and
//     then deletes any oneOf/anyOf branch that was left with nothing else
//     in it. A branch written as x-gts-ref alone therefore disappears, and
//     `instead` would silently stop accepting component ids at all. With
//     the pattern kept, a malformed id still fails by name.
// Enforcement of the reference itself (does this id resolve?) happens where
// The full declaration a field holding another component's id carries: what
// it must resolve to, the value kind, and the grammar. All three, because
// gts-ts strips `x-gts-ref` before Ajv sees the schema, so the `pattern` is

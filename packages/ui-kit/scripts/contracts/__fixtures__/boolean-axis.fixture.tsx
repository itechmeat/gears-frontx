// Fixture for extract.test.ts and compile.test.ts: a cva config with a
// BOOLEAN variant alongside a string one.
//
// class-variance-authority keys a boolean variant's map by `true`/`false`
// and `VariantProps` types the resulting prop as `boolean`. Read as an
// ordinary string axis, the compiled contract stated a prop accepting only
// the strings "true" and "false" - a shape no caller can satisfy, since
// `fullWidth` takes a boolean - and its default was lost outright: a
// `defaultVariants` entry written as `false` is not a string literal, and a
// note saying so that did not begin `cva:` would fail nothing.
//
// `emphasis` is the control: a real string axis in the same config, so a
// test can tell "read a boolean axis as boolean" apart from "read every axis
// as boolean".

// Freshness: whether the artifact committed next to a component's source
// (<name>.contract.json) is exactly what compiling the component right now
// produces. The host elements' surfaces
// are hand-written source, not compiler output, so there is nothing to
// compare them against - what the conformance suite checks about them instead
// is that their identifiers obey the grammar and that the reference a contract
// holds resolves to a file that exists. Both the per-component vitest suite (see testing.ts) and
// the merge-scoped guard (check.ts's `guard` subcommand) need the identical
// comparison - one to fail a test with a diff, the other to fail a CI check
// with the same diff - so the comparison lives here once; each caller only
// decides how to report it.

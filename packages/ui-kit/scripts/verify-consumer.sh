#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Acceptance check #1: the packed @gears-frontx/ui-kit installs into a clean
# Vite project and the project builds a page that uses the kit's components
# and CSS. Run from anywhere; requires npm and node. `npm pack` works on a
# private package — only `publish` is blocked.
#
# Since the per-entry repackaging (see design-notes.md's Architecture
# section), this is also the tree-shaking proof: every consumer page below
# imports only `Button`. A bundle that pulled in every component regardless
# of what's imported (the old single dist/index.js + dist/index.css defect)
# would still pass a presence-only check, so this script asserts BOTH
# directions — Button's hashed class/CSS present, and a hashed class/CSS
# from a component the page never imported (Table, Dialog — both have large,
# distinctive CSS) absent.
#
# FOUR bundler-facing legs, not one, plus a types leg. This is not
# belt-and-braces — each guards something the others provably do not:
#
#   - [vite]: the ecosystem's own tooling; primary consumer check.
#   - [esbuild-barrel]: importing the barrel (`@gears-frontx/ui-kit`)
#     through raw esbuild. Measured directly: Vite's production build goes
#     through Rollup, whose tree-shaking already cascades "this ui-kit
#     wrapper export is unused" through to "therefore the Base UI submodule
#     it exclusively imported is unused too" — true even against the
#     *pre-repackaging* single dist/index.js (grepped the old build's Vite
#     consumer output for Select/Menu/Toast/FloatingFocusManager identifiers:
#     absent). Raw esbuild's bundler does not cascade that elimination: a
#     Button-only page bundled with esbuild against the pre-repackaging
#     tarball retained ~614KB unminified / 233KB minified of unreached Base
#     UI internals (SelectRoot, MenuRoot, ToastRoot, FloatingFocusManager,
#     @floating-ui/dom — none reachable from Button), solely because they
#     were all unconditionally imported somewhere in the one bundled
#     dist/index.js. So a Vite-only gate would prove the CSS fix but
#     silently miss this JS regression. `/* @__PURE__ */` on the kit's
#     cva() calls does not fix it either (verified: byte-identical esbuild
#     output with and without the annotation on button/card/tabs/select/
#     switch/dropdown-menu/badge) — the retention is Base UI's own
#     submodules, unrelated to the kit's variant-styling calls. This leg
#     guards a real, previously-invisible consumer-facing regression; it is
#     not redundant with [vite] and should not be deleted as such. (The
#     numbers above are from that investigation, built with --minify; this
#     leg itself deliberately builds unminified — see the comment at its
#     esbuild invocation for why minifying would break its own probes.)
#   - [esbuild-subpath]: importing a component's own subpath
#     (`@gears-frontx/ui-kit/button`) through raw esbuild. Exists because of
#     a second, independent esbuild finding: esbuild does not tree-shake CSS
#     the way it tree-shakes JS. A BARREL import bundled with esbuild
#     correctly drops unreached components' JS (proven by [esbuild-barrel]
#     above) but still ships every component's CSS regardless — swept
#     `sideEffects` as `["**/*.css"]`, `["*.css"]`, and `false` and got the
#     same full-CSS result every time, so this is not a `sideEffects` bug to
#     fix; esbuild collects CSS from the whole reachable module graph
#     independently of which JS bindings survive tree-shaking. Importing a
#     component's SUBPATH instead resolves straight to that component's own
#     chunk, whose module graph never reaches the other 18 components' CSS
#     in the first place — which is why this leg, uniquely, asserts CSS
#     presence/absence rather than JS. Do not fold this into
#     [esbuild-barrel]'s assertions: a barrel entry cannot pass a CSS-absence
#     check under esbuild today, and asserting it there would either be a
#     permanently-red check or a silently-weakened one.
#   - [webpack]: the barrel import through webpack 5 in production mode.
#     Exists because webpack is the one bundler here that actually READS
#     `sideEffects` from package.json — and the one bundler none of the
#     other legs run. Mutation-tested: with `sideEffects` flipped to
#     `false` (a plausible-looking future "simplification"), webpack
#     silently drops every component's CSS import as dead code — Button's
#     own styles included — while [vite], both [esbuild-*] legs and
#     [types] all stay green (Vite re-marks CSS side-effectful in its own
#     CSS plugin; esbuild ignores the field for CSS entirely). So the exact
#     regression that would blank out every webpack consumer — and
#     insight-front, the kit's first declared consumer, builds with
#     webpack — was invisible to the whole gate. This leg's CSS-presence
#     assertion is the guard; its absence assertions also prove webpack's
#     sideEffects-driven pruning keeps working in the wanted direction
#     (unused components' CSS *should* drop out of a barrel build).
#   - [types]: `tsc` under both `moduleResolution: "nodenext"` and
#     `"bundler"`, for the barrel and three subpaths. Exists because the
#     per-entry repackaging's relative `.d.ts` specifiers are a types-only
#     surface no test above exercises — a nodenext consumer rejecting every
#     symbol in the package is invisible to unit tests, `tsc --noEmit` on
#     the kit's own source (which uses `bundler` resolution), and every
#     bundler leg above (runtime resolution was never broken, only the
#     types). This regressed once already; this leg exists so it cannot
#     regress silently a second time.

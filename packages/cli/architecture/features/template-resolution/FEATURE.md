## 1. Feature Context

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`

### 1.1 Overview

The CLI (`@gears-frontx/cli`) bundles no template and resolves each template from an external source by versioned source-spec (`host:owner/repo[//subtree]@ref`) at runtime, materializing the template's actual files on disk in a tracked local inventory at an addressable installed content path — not a single manifest blob — so downstream apply and assembly read that content directly, and providing install, list, and bounded local update operations that never disturb already-scaffolded projects. The optional `//subtree` segment addresses a template occupying a subtree of a repository, so one repository can serve several templates; the acquired content is narrowed to that subtree and re-rooted, leaving a template unaware of where in a repository it lives. A template is tracked under the identity its own manifest declares, not under the name of the repository it came from, and an install whose declared identity is already occupied by a different source is rejected before any inventory write rather than merged into the occupant's content path.

### 1.2 Purpose

This feature ensures the CLI command surface is fully decoupled from the content it scaffolds: templates are acquired by versioned reference at runtime, stored in a tracked local inventory, and updatable locally without affecting any scaffolded project. This realizes the CLI-1 design constraint and the template-agnostic-tooling principle.

**Requirements**: `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-install`, `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-list`, `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-update-local`

**Principles**: `cpt-frontx-principle-template-agnostic-tooling`

### 1.5 Machine-Readable Listing Envelope

This feature owns the concrete shape of the listing command's machine-readable form, because that form is a **cross-boundary contract**: it is the surface over which the AI Tooling Framework obtains the selectable set (`cpt-frontx-feature-ai-project-scaffolding`) without linking the CLI or reading its inventory storage (DESIGN §3.4). A consumer on the far side of a process boundary cannot discover the shape by reading the producer's types, so the shape is fixed here rather than left to whichever formatter happens to emit it - the same reason `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest` fixes the manifest's field-level schema in its own §1.2 and `cpt-frontx-feature-template-ai-extensions` fixes the bundle convention in its §1.5.

**Request**: the listing command invoked with the `--json` flag. Absent the flag, the human-readable form is emitted unchanged; the two forms never mix on one invocation.

**Response**: exactly one line of JSON on standard output, matching the one-line result convention the upgrade command's machine-readable handshake already established on this command surface:

```json
{"ok": true, "templates": [{"name": "...", "ref": "...", "source": "...", "description": "..."}]}
```

- `ok` - always `true` for a successful enumeration; present so a consumer distinguishes a result line from any other output on the stream, and so a future failure form can be added without changing the success shape.
- `templates` - one record per inventory entry, in inventory order. An empty inventory yields `[]`, never an absent key and never the human-readable empty message.
- `name` - the identity the template's own manifest declares, and the argument the seed and add commands take.
- `ref` - the reference the entry is pinned at, as recorded from the source-spec's `@ref` segment. This is the acquisition reference, **not** the manifest's `version` field; the two need not agree in form or value.
- `source` - the full source-spec the entry was resolved from, re-resolvable as-is.
- `description` - the description the entry's manifest declares. **The key is absent, never empty and never a placeholder, when the entry declares none** - a consumer selects templates by this value, and a substituted placeholder would be indistinguishable from a declaration the template never made.
- `manifestUnreadable` - present, and only ever `true`, when the entry's stored manifest no longer satisfies the manifest contract, so no description could be read from it. Absent otherwise, matching `description`'s own convention. It exists because that case and "declares none" both leave `description` absent while calling for opposite responses: a template that declares none is working as intended and is simply not selectable from an intent, whereas an unreadable manifest is a broken installation to reinstall. Reporting the first for the second would be wrong at exactly the moment it matters, and a future tightening of the manifest contract would invalidate stored manifests wholesale and silently report an entire inventory as declaring nothing.

The key names are the contract; renaming one is a breaking change to the AI Tooling Framework's read path even though no compile-time edge would report it.

### 1.6 Bundled Agent-Skill Delivery

Acquiring a template makes the CLI usable; it does not make an agent in an arbitrary directory know that the CLI exists or how the scaffolding capability is driven. That knowledge is the AI Tooling Framework's kit (`cpt-frontx-feature-ai-project-scaffolding`), and until it is installed where the developer's agent host looks for capabilities, a session opened outside a FrontX project has no route from "build me a console" to this command surface. Acquisition is the one moment the developer is already reaching for FrontX tooling, so it is where the kit is delivered.

**Bundled, not fetched.** The CLI distribution carries the kit's agent-skill files as package assets, copied in at build time from the kit package. Delivery therefore performs no network call, needs no second source-spec, and cannot leave the developer with a skill that disagrees with the CLI they are running: the two ship as one artifact. It also does not make the CLI depend on the kit at runtime or at compile time (CLI-1 stands) - the assets are inert files the build placed in the distribution.

**Kit-root shaped.** The deployed directory is laid out exactly as an installed kit root: the kit's own `SKILL.md` at its top, `AGENTS.md` and `guidelines/` beside it, and the scaffolding capability at `skills/project-scaffolding/`. The scaffolding document addresses its siblings by their kit-root-relative paths, so a layout that flattened or renamed them would break every one of those references.

**Replaced whole, every time.** Delivery removes whatever the target directory holds and writes the bundled set over it, on every successful acquisition rather than only on the first. A file an earlier CLI version shipped and this one dropped would otherwise stay behind and be read as part of the current skill, and a merge would leave the developer running two versions at once.

**Never fatal.** The target directory belongs to the developer's agent host, not to the CLI, and it can be absent, read-only, or owned by another user. A delivery that fails reports the reason as a warning on an otherwise successful acquisition; it never turns an installed template into a failed install, because the template is in the inventory either way and refusing to say so would be a false report.

**Located by the host, overridable by the caller.** The default target is the per-user agent-skill directory of the host the CLI is run under. An explicit environment override takes precedence, resolved against the working directory when given as a relative path - the same precedence rule the inventory root already follows (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-acquisition-and-location`), so a CI job or a test can redirect the delivery without changing any calling code.

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

User-facing interactions that start with an actor (human or external system) and describe the end-to-end flow of a use case. Each flow has a triggering actor and shows how the system responds to actor actions.

**Use cases**: `cpt-frontx-usecase-scaffold-composed-project`

### Install Template by Versioned Source-Spec

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-install`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Developer installs a template and it is added to the local inventory at the pinned version

**Error Scenarios**:
- Source registry is unreachable; install fails with an error before any inventory write
- Source-spec is missing the `host:` prefix or the `@ref` selector, or carries a malformed subtree segment; rejected before any fetch
- The referenced subtree holds no content at the referenced version; install fails with an error before any inventory write
- The fetched template declares an identity the local inventory already tracks for a different template address; install is rejected before any inventory write. A reference differing only in its version selector names the same template and is not a collision
- The fetched template declares an identity that nests with an already-installed identity, one being a leading path segment sequence of the other; install is rejected before any inventory write, because the two are two inventory keys but not two directories
- The bundled agent skill cannot be delivered - the distribution carries no bundled assets, or the target directory cannot be written; the template stays installed and the developer is told why the skill was not refreshed. A delivery failure never fails the install, because the template is in the inventory either way

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Developer invokes the CLI install command with a versioned source-spec (`host:owner/repo[//subtree]@ref`) - `inst-install-invoke`
2. [x] - `p1` - CLI forwards the source-spec string to the source-spec parser - `inst-install-parse`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the parser returns a parse error (missing `host:` prefix, missing `@ref` selector, or a malformed repository path or subtree segment): - `inst-install-parse-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** parse error to developer; abort install with no inventory write - `inst-install-parse-reject`
4. [x] - `p1` - CLI forwards the parsed structured reference to the shared resolver - `inst-install-resolve`
5. [x] - `p1` - Shared resolver attempts to fetch template content from the source registry (`cpt-frontx-actor-github`) at the resolved ref - `inst-install-fetch`
6. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the source registry is unreachable or returns an error: - `inst-install-reach-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** connectivity error to developer; abort install with no inventory write - `inst-install-reach-fail`
7. [x] - `p1` - CLI materializes the fetched content into the tracked local inventory under the identity the fetched template's manifest declares and the pinned version - `inst-install-materialize`
8. [x] - `p1` - CLI replaces the contents of the per-user agent-skill directory with the agent-skill assets its own distribution bundles (§1.6), so the capability that drives this command surface is present wherever the developer's agent host looks for it - `inst-install-deliver-agent-skill`
9. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the delivery cannot be performed, because the distribution carries no bundled assets or the target directory cannot be written: - `inst-install-deliver-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** install success carrying a delivery warning that names the target directory and the reason the delivery was refused; the installed inventory entry stands and the install is not failed - `inst-install-deliver-warn`
10. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** install success with the installed identity, pinned version, and the delivered agent-skill directory to developer - `inst-install-success`

### List Local Template Inventory

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-list`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Developer sees all templates installed in the local inventory with their pinned versions
- Caller requests the machine-readable listing and receives, per installed template, its identity, pinned reference, source address, and the description its manifest declares - the form a program consumes over the command surface without parsing prose
- An installed template's stored manifest no longer satisfies the manifest contract; the machine-readable form lists the entry, carries no description for it, and marks it as having an unreadable manifest, so the caller can tell a broken installation from a template that simply declares nothing

**Error Scenarios**:
- Local inventory is empty; CLI reports an empty inventory with no error, as the empty message in the human form and as an empty collection in the machine-readable form
- The invocation carries an argument that is not the recognized machine-readable flag: the command is refused with a usage line naming the unrecognized argument, and neither listing form is emitted. A near-miss flag must not fall through to the human form, because a calling program would then receive a success exit code alongside output it cannot parse - a silently wrong answer where a refusal it can act on was available. Repeating the recognized flag is not an error: it names the same form unambiguously.

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Developer or calling program invokes the CLI list command, optionally requesting the machine-readable form - `inst-list-invoke`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the invocation carries any argument that is not the recognized machine-readable flag - `inst-list-check-args`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the command refused, naming the unrecognized argument(s) and the accepted usage form; no listing is emitted in either form - `inst-list-abort-unknown-arg`
3. [x] - `p1` - CLI reads the tracked local inventory index - `inst-list-read`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the inventory index contains no entries: - `inst-list-empty-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** empty inventory message to developer, or an empty collection when the machine-readable form was requested - `inst-list-empty-return`
5. [x] - `p1` - CLI formats each inventory entry as name and pinned version - `inst-list-format`
6. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the machine-readable form was requested, CLI instead emits one structured record per inventory entry carrying identity, pinned reference, source address, and the description declared by the manifest the entry records - omitting the description for an entry whose manifest declares none, rather than substituting a placeholder a caller could mistake for a declaration, and marking as unreadable an entry whose stored manifest no longer satisfies the manifest contract so that the two causes of an absent description stay distinguishable - `inst-list-format-machine`
7. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** formatted inventory listing to developer - `inst-list-return`

### Update Installed Template in Local Inventory

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-update-local`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Developer updates a specific inventory entry to a newer version; no scaffolded project path is modified

**Error Scenarios**:
- Named template is not found in local inventory; CLI reports the error and makes no changes
- Source registry is unreachable; CLI reports the error and leaves the existing inventory entry unchanged
- The new source-spec resolves to a template declaring a different identity; CLI reports the error and leaves the existing inventory entry unchanged rather than substituting one template for another
- The bundled agent skill cannot be delivered; the inventory entry stays updated and the developer is told why the skill was not refreshed, exactly as on install

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Developer invokes the CLI update-local command with the template name and a new versioned source-spec - `inst-update-invoke`
2. [x] - `p1` - CLI looks up the named entry in the tracked local inventory index - `inst-update-lookup`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the named entry is absent from the local inventory: - `inst-update-notfound-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** not-found error to developer; abort update with no inventory write - `inst-update-notfound`
4. [x] - `p1` - CLI forwards the new source-spec to the source-spec parser - `inst-update-parse`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the parser returns a parse error: - `inst-update-parse-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** parse error to developer; abort update with no inventory write - `inst-update-parse-reject`
6. [x] - `p1` - CLI forwards the parsed reference to the shared resolver and fetches the updated content from the source registry - `inst-update-fetch`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the source registry is unreachable or returns an error: - `inst-update-reach-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** connectivity error to developer; leave the existing inventory entry unchanged - `inst-update-reach-fail`
8. [x] - `p1` - CLI replaces the inventory store entry for the named template with the fetched content at the new pinned version - `inst-update-write`
9. [x] - `p1` - CLI replaces the contents of the per-user agent-skill directory with the agent-skill assets its own distribution bundles (§1.6), on the same terms as install: a developer who updates but never re-installs is otherwise left on whichever skill version the last install delivered - `inst-update-deliver-agent-skill`
10. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the delivery cannot be performed: - `inst-update-deliver-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** update success carrying a delivery warning that names the target directory and the reason; the updated inventory entry stands and the update is not failed - `inst-update-deliver-warn`
11. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** update success with the template name, new pinned version, and the delivered agent-skill directory to developer - `inst-update-success`

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

Internal system functions and procedures that do not interact with actors directly. These are reusable building blocks called by Actor Flows or other processes.

### Source-Spec Parse and Validate

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-parse-spec`

**Input**: A raw source-spec string supplied by the developer

**Output**: A structured reference (host, owner, repo, optional subtree, ref) or a parse error

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Check that the input string contains a `:` separator - `inst-parse-prefix-check`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** no `:` separator is present: - `inst-parse-no-prefix`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** parse error: missing `host:` prefix; acquisition cannot proceed without an explicit host - `inst-parse-no-prefix-fail`
3. [x] - `p1` - Extract the host token as the substring before the first `:` - `inst-parse-extract-host`
4. [x] - `p1` - Check that the remainder after `:` contains an `@` separator - `inst-parse-at-check`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** no `@` separator is present: - `inst-parse-no-at`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** parse error: missing `@ref` version selector; acquisition cannot proceed without an explicit version pin - `inst-parse-no-at-fail`
6. [x] - `p1` - Extract the repository path as the substring between `:` and `@` - `inst-parse-extract-repo`
7. [x] - `p1` - Split the repository path on its first `//` separator into an `owner/repo` part and an optional subtree part - `inst-parse-extract-subtree`
8. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the `owner/repo` part is not exactly one owner segment followed by one repository segment, or a subtree separator is present with a subtree part that is empty, absolute, or carries an empty, `.`, or `..` segment: - `inst-parse-invalid-path`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** parse error: malformed repository path or subtree segment; acquisition cannot proceed without an unambiguous repository and subtree - `inst-parse-invalid-path-fail`
9. [x] - `p1` - Extract the ref selector as the substring after `@` - `inst-parse-extract-ref`
10. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** structured reference containing host, owner, repo, the subtree when present, and ref - `inst-parse-return`

### Resolve Source-Spec to Tracked Local Inventory

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-resolve-to-inventory`

**Input**: A validated structured reference (host, owner, repo, optional subtree, ref)

**Output**: A materialized inventory entry (identity, installed content path addressing the template's actual on-disk files, pinned version) or a resolution error

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Construct the fetch address for the source registry (`cpt-frontx-actor-github`) from the structured reference, and the re-resolvable source-spec string that reproduces it — including its subtree when the reference carries one, so a later re-resolution addresses the same template rather than the repository root - `inst-resolve-addr`
2. [x] - `p1` - Fetch the template content from the source registry at the given ref - `inst-resolve-fetch`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the fetch fails: - `inst-resolve-fetch-fail-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** resolution error; do not write to local inventory - `inst-resolve-fetch-fail`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the reference carries a subtree, narrow the acquired content to that subtree and re-root every retained path so it is relative to the subtree rather than to the repository - `inst-resolve-subtree`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the acquired content is not a multi-file bundle, the referenced subtree holds no content at the referenced version, or narrowing would re-root a retained path outside the subtree: - `inst-resolve-subtree-empty`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** resolution error naming the subtree and, where a path is at fault, that path; do not write to local inventory - `inst-resolve-subtree-empty-fail`
6. [x] - `p1` - Read the template's manifest from the acquired content and take the identity it declares as the template's identity - `inst-resolve-name`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the manifest is absent, unreadable, or declares an identity that is empty or not usable as an installed content path — an identity must be relative and free of empty, `.` and `..` segments, while a scoped identity carrying a `/` remains admissible - `inst-resolve-identity-missing`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** resolution error; do not write to local inventory - `inst-resolve-identity-missing-fail`
8. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the local inventory already tracks that identity for a different template address — the reference with its version selector removed, so that a reference differing only in version names the same template rather than a colliding one — **OR** the declared identity nests with an identity the inventory already tracks, one being a leading path segment sequence of the other, because two nesting identities are two inventory keys but not two directories and a bounded update of the outer one clears the inner one from disk while leaving it indexed: - `inst-resolve-collision-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** resolution error naming the occupying identity together with the requested one, and for an address collision both sources; do not write to local inventory and do not merge into or nest beneath the occupant's content path - `inst-resolve-collision-fail`
9. [x] - `p1` - Materialize the acquired template content — the template's actual files together with its manifest — on disk in the local inventory store under the declared identity, addressable at an installed content path - `inst-resolve-write`
10. [x] - `p1` - Record the installed identity and pinned ref in the inventory index - `inst-resolve-index`
11. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** inventory entry containing identity, installed content path, and pinned version - `inst-resolve-return`

### Bounded Local Inventory Update

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-bounded-update`

**Input**: Template name and a validated structured reference for the new version

**Output**: An updated inventory entry (name, new pinned version) or an update error; scaffolded projects are not touched

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Look up the named entry in the inventory index - `inst-bupd-lookup`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the named entry is absent: - `inst-bupd-absent-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** not-found error; abort with no inventory write - `inst-bupd-absent-fail`
3. [x] - `p1` - Fetch the new template content from the source registry at the new ref using the shared resolver - `inst-bupd-fetch`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the fetch fails: - `inst-bupd-fetch-fail-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** fetch error; leave the existing inventory entry unchanged - `inst-bupd-fetch-fail`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the newly fetched content declares an identity other than the entry being updated: - `inst-bupd-identity-mismatch`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** update error naming both the entry's identity and the declared one; leave the existing inventory entry unchanged, since replacing it would substitute one template for another under the entry's identity - `inst-bupd-identity-mismatch-fail`
6. [x] - `p1` - Replace the named template's materialized files in the inventory store with the newly fetched content at its installed content path - `inst-bupd-replace`
7. [x] - `p1` - Update the inventory index to record the new pinned ref for the named entry - `inst-bupd-index-update`
8. [x] - `p1` - Confirm that no paths outside the local inventory store were written during this operation - `inst-bupd-boundary-confirm`
9. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** updated inventory entry containing name and new pinned version - `inst-bupd-return`

## 4. States (CDSL)

Include when entities have explicit lifecycle states.

### Inventory Template State Machine

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-state-template-resolution-inventory-lifecycle`

**States**: UNRESOLVED, RESOLVED, INSTALLED, UPDATED

**Initial State**: UNRESOLVED

**Transitions**:
1. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** UNRESOLVED **TO** RESOLVED **WHEN** the source-spec is successfully parsed and the source registry returns the template content for the given ref - `inst-state-to-resolved`
2. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** RESOLVED **TO** INSTALLED **WHEN** the fetched content is materialized into the local inventory store and the inventory index is updated with the pinned version - `inst-state-to-installed`
3. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** INSTALLED **TO** UPDATED **WHEN** a bounded local update fetches new content for the named inventory entry, replaces it in the inventory store, and updates the index without touching any scaffolded project - `inst-state-to-updated`
4. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** UNRESOLVED **TO** UNRESOLVED **WHEN** source-spec parse validation fails (missing `host:` prefix, missing `@ref` selector, or a malformed repository path or subtree segment) and the inventory is not written - `inst-state-parse-fail-loop`
5. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** RESOLVED **TO** UNRESOLVED **WHEN** the source registry fetch fails after a successful parse and the inventory is not written - `inst-state-fetch-fail-loop`
6. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** RESOLVED **TO** UNRESOLVED **WHEN** the referenced subtree holds no content, the acquired content declares no usable identity, or the declared identity is already tracked for a different source-spec, and the inventory is not written - `inst-state-reject-loop`

## 5. Definitions of Done

Specific implementation tasks derived from flows/algorithms above.

### CLI Installs Template by Versioned Source-Spec

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-template-resolution-install-by-spec`

The system **MUST** install a template into the local inventory by resolving a developer-supplied `host:owner/repo[//subtree]@ref` source-spec through the shared resolver, materialize the fetched content as the template's actual on-disk files in the tracked inventory store addressable at an installed content path (not a single manifest blob), and record the pinned version — with zero template content bundled in the CLI distribution. When the source-spec carries a subtree segment, the system **MUST** materialize only that subtree, re-rooted so every materialized path is relative to the subtree rather than to the repository, and **MUST** retain the subtree in the re-resolvable source-spec it records.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-install`
- `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-parse-spec`
- `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-resolve-to-inventory`

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-template-independence`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Template`

### CLI Lists Local Template Inventory

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-template-resolution-list-inventory`

The system **MUST** enumerate all entries in the tracked local inventory and report each installed template name with its pinned version when the developer invokes the list command, and **MUST** additionally offer a machine-readable form of the same enumeration carrying each entry's identity, pinned reference, source address, and manifest-declared description - the surface over which a calling program obtains the selectable set without reading the inventory's storage. An entry whose manifest declares no description carries none in that form, an entry whose stored manifest no longer satisfies the manifest contract is marked as unreadable rather than reported as declaring none, and the command **MUST** refuse an invocation carrying any argument that is not the recognized machine-readable flag rather than falling through to either listing form (`target` for the machine-readable form and for the argument refusal).

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-list`

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-template-independence`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Template`
- CLI: list command, machine-readable output form (`target`)

### CLI Updates Local Inventory Entry Without Touching Scaffolded Projects

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-template-resolution-bounded-local-update`

The system **MUST** replace a named inventory entry with the newly fetched content at the new pinned version, writing exclusively within the local inventory store and leaving every scaffolded project path unchanged.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-update-local`
- `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-bounded-update`

### CLI Delivers the Bundled Agent Skill on Every Successful Acquisition

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-template-resolution-agent-skill-delivery`

The system **MUST** carry the AI Tooling Framework kit's agent-skill files in its own distribution as build-time assets — the kit's `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, its guidelines, and the scaffolding capability's document, checklist and verification driver, each at its kit-root-relative path — and **MUST**, after every successful install and every successful bounded local update, replace the contents of the per-user agent-skill directory with that bundled set, so the capability that drives this command surface is present wherever the developer's agent host looks for it. The target directory **MUST** default to the host's per-user agent-skill location and **MUST** yield to an explicit environment override, resolved against the working directory when relative. The delivery **MUST** replace rather than merge, so a file an earlier version shipped and this one dropped does not survive into the current skill, and **MUST** be idempotent: a second acquisition leaves the directory byte-identical to the first. A delivery that cannot be performed — no bundled assets in the distribution, or a target directory that cannot be written — **MUST** be reported as a warning naming the target directory and the refused thing, and **MUST NOT** fail the acquisition that triggered it, because the template is in the inventory either way and reporting otherwise would name a failure that did not happen.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-install`
- `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-update-local`

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-template-independence`

**Touches**:
- CLI: install command, update-local command, bundled distribution assets

### Source-Spec Parser Rejects Invalid References

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-template-resolution-spec-parser-rejection`

The system **MUST** reject any source-spec that omits the `host:` prefix or the `@ref` version selector before any fetch or inventory write is attempted, **MUST** reject rather than reinterpret a repository path whose segment count is not two, an empty or trailing-slash subtree segment, and a subtree segment carrying an empty, `.`, or `..` segment, **MUST** round-trip a valid `host:owner/repo//subtree@ref` reference into its five constituent parts (host, owner, repo, subtree, ref), and **MUST** parse a reference without the subtree segment into the same four parts as before, carrying no subtree.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-parse-spec`

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-template-independence`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Template`

### Template Identity Comes From the Manifest and Collisions Are Rejected

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-template-resolution-manifest-identity`

The system **MUST** take a template's identity from the identity its own manifest declares rather than from the repository the reference names, and **MUST** use that identity as the inventory index key, as the installed content path, and as the identity recorded for the template. The system **MUST** reject a reference whose acquired content carries no readable manifest or declares an identity that is empty or not usable as an installed content path — relative, free of empty, `.` and `..` segments, with a scoped identity carrying a `/` remaining admissible — and **MUST** reject an install whose declared identity is already tracked for a different template address — naming both the occupying source and the requested one — rather than writing into the occupant's content path, while admitting a reference that differs only in its version selector, which names the same template at another version. The system **MUST** likewise reject an install whose declared identity nests with an identity the inventory already tracks, one being a leading path segment sequence of the other, naming the occupying identity: two nesting identities are two inventory keys but not two directories, so a bounded update of the outer one clears the inner one from disk while leaving it indexed.

- `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-resolve-to-inventory`

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-template-independence`

**Touches**:

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CLI install command resolves a valid `host:owner/repo@ref` source-spec, fetches from the source registry, and writes the result to the local inventory at the pinned version
- [ ] CLI install command with a source-spec missing the `host:` prefix or the `@ref` selector fails with a parse error before any fetch or inventory write
- [ ] CLI install command resolves a valid `host:owner/repo//subtree@ref` source-spec and materializes only that subtree, with every materialized path relative to the subtree rather than to the repository
- [ ] A source-spec whose repository path does not consist of exactly one owner segment and one repository segment, or whose subtree segment is empty, trailing-slash, or carries an empty, `.`, or `..` segment, fails with a parse error before any fetch or inventory write
- [ ] A source-spec naming a subtree that holds no content at the referenced version fails with an error identifying the subtree, and nothing is written to the local inventory
- [ ] A subtree whose acquired content carries a path that escapes the subtree once re-rooted is refused outright, and nothing is written to the local inventory
- [ ] The identity a template is tracked under is the identity its manifest declares, and it is the inventory index key, the installed content path segment, and the identity recorded in the re-resolvable source-spec's provenance
- [ ] Two source-specs differing only in their subtree segment, whose manifests declare different identities, install as two distinct templates from one repository at one version, each at its own installed content path; if the two declare one identity the second install is refused as a collision
- [ ] Installing a template whose declared identity is already tracked for a different source-spec fails with an error naming both sources, and the occupying template's content path is left unmodified
- [ ] Installing a template whose declared identity nests with an already-installed identity, such as `@acme/tools/extra` against an installed `@acme/tools`, fails with an error naming the occupying identity, and nothing is written under the occupant's content path
- [ ] CLI list command returns all installed templates and their pinned versions from the local inventory
- [ ] CLI list command reports an empty inventory when no templates are installed
- [x] CLI list command offers a machine-readable form carrying each installed template's identity, pinned reference, source address, and manifest-declared description, emitting an empty collection for an empty inventory and no description for an entry whose manifest declares none (`target`)
- [x] CLI list command refuses an unrecognized argument with a usage line naming it, emitting neither listing form, while a repeated recognized flag is accepted (`target`)
- [x] An entry whose stored manifest no longer satisfies the manifest contract is listed with no description and marked unreadable, distinguishably from an entry that conforms and declares none (`target`)
- [ ] CLI update-local command replaces the named inventory entry with newly fetched content at the new pinned version, leaving every scaffolded project path unmodified
- [ ] CLI update-local command reports a not-found error when the named template is absent from the local inventory
- [x] A successful install replaces the contents of the per-user agent-skill directory with the distribution's bundled agent-skill assets, and reports the delivered directory on one line of the command's human output (`target`)
- [x] A successful bounded local update delivers the bundled agent skill on the same terms as install (`target`)
- [x] An explicit environment override redirects the delivery, taking precedence over the per-user default and resolving against the working directory when given as a relative path (`target`)
- [x] A second acquisition re-delivers over the first, leaving the target directory holding exactly the bundled set and nothing an earlier delivery left behind (`target`)
- [x] An acquisition whose agent-skill delivery fails still reports the template as installed or updated, at a success exit code, with the delivery reported as a warning naming the target directory and the reason (`target`)
- [ ] No template content is bundled in the CLI distribution (zero template assets or dependencies in the CLI package). The bundled agent-skill assets of §1.6 are not template content: they are the solution-agnostic tooling kit, they name no template, and they carry no dependency on one
- [ ] Inventory template state machine cycles UNRESOLVED → RESOLVED → INSTALLED → UPDATED under successful install and update flows

# FrontX AI Tooling Kit — Agent Navigation Rules

## Package Boundaries (always enforce)

- Ecosystem packages: `mfes`, `gts-plugin`, `api`, `cli`, `cyber-pilot-kit-frontx`
- Template packages: the active template (external, source-spec-resolved) and its sub-packages
- Never add ecosystem→template imports; never add template→ecosystem src-level coupling

## When running a command

- macOS ships no `timeout` command, so a call wrapped in `timeout <seconds> ...` dies with "command not found" and reads as a broken tool rather than a missing binary. Bound a slow call with the timeout parameter the tool issuing it already carries, never with a shell wrapper

## When searching the filesystem

- Scope every search to the tree being worked in: the project directory, the repository, or the single package under change. Never search from `/`, from the home directory, or from any parent of the working tree
- An unscoped search is not thorough, it is a scan of everything the machine holds. One `find /` issued during a scaffolding run cost 93.6 seconds of pure filesystem walk and surfaced nothing the project tree did not already carry
- A path that is not where it should be is absent. Widen the search inside the tree, or report the absence; widening past the tree answers a different question than the one asked

## When adding code to ecosystem packages

- Check DESIGN.md for the relevant component boundary constraint (MFES-*, API-*, CLI-*, KIT-*)
- Run `npm run build` and `npm run test` inside the package before reporting done
- All resource ids in kit manifests MUST begin with `frontx_` (KIT-1)

## When implementing an action a user invokes

- The action must let a user reach the outcome its own label names, carrying data they supplied. A handler that produces the payload itself - a constant, an empty field, a record nobody entered - is a stub: the control is there and the outcome the user came for is not reachable
- Where an intent names an action but says nothing about how the user's data gets in, that gap is what to report. Filling it with a fixed value satisfies the wording of the intent and defeats the action

## When verifying a user interface

- Judge the rendered pixels, not the tree behind them. A DOM snapshot proves an element exists and a click proves it can be operated; neither proves a person can see it. Every interactive element must be visually distinguishable while at rest, in every theme the interface supports - one that emerges only under hover or focus fails. The archetype is a destructive action wearing a ghost or text-only variant: a delete control that renders as bare text is at rest indistinguishable from a caption, and it is the one control a person must be able to tell apart before they touch it. Shipped in a screenshot that was looked at and passed, it is the failure this rule exists to catch
- The theme an interface opens in is one of the themes it supports, never the set - and on a browser attached to an existing profile it is not even a theme this run chose, it is whatever that profile last persisted. A pass that captured only the theme it happened to find has seen a fraction of the surface, and a run that reported a verified interface while a whole theme stayed unopened claimed a coverage it never had
- A screenshot is evidence only once it has been examined. Take one per screen per theme, in the states that carry the meaning - a form before it is submitted, a list before and after it changes - with no debug or development overlay across the surface, and read each for what a structural check cannot see: elements invisible or cramped, panels over content, layers colliding. Verification is not complete while a captured screenshot is unexamined
- A judgement on a screenshot names what it looked at: which elements, in which state, in which theme. "Looks correct" records a feeling and conceals whatever went unexamined, and a cramped button survived two consecutive runs behind judgements phrased that way
- A verification reports its coverage, not its verdict. An unopened theme is a legitimate outcome and belongs in the report as one; a closing summary phrased so that no reader can tell it apart from full coverage is how two consecutive runs shipped a single theme as a verified interface. What the coverage list has to contain, and where it is produced, is stated by the procedure the run followed
- A workaround is a finding. If confirming something took piercing a shadow root, evaluating script, or reading markup the interface does not display, then the user cannot perceive it either. Record it as a defect - a check that needed the bypass did not pass
- The command that runs the headless browser is `npx --yes agent-browser`, and every later call repeats that exact prefix. The bare binary is not on `PATH`, so a call that drops the prefix fails as a command that does not exist, and six consecutive runs each spent 20 to 40 seconds rediscovering that
- How a browser is reached, which themes are walked and how the run is driven between captures is procedure, and belongs in the numbered steps of the capability being run rather than here. Three consecutive runs read these rules as prose and produced none of it; the same runs executed every check that reached them as a numbered step. A rule of this kind that has to be obeyed is written where the steps are

## When working with the CLI

- CLI resolves templates by source-spec at runtime; it bundles no template content
- Source-spec format: `host:owner/repo[//subtree]@ref` — the optional `//subtree` addresses a template occupying a subdirectory of a repository
- Supported commands are `install`, `list`, `update-local`, `validate`, `seed`, `add`, `upgrade`, and `help`
- `seed` applies a template into a **new** repository, `add` into an **existing** one; both take the identity the template's own manifest declares, which is what `list` reports. `seed` refuses a target that already holds content and names the exact rule in its refusal - read that rather than reproducing the rule here, since a copy of it in this file is a copy that falls out of step
- **`seed`, `add` and `upgrade` write into a directory the developer keeps, and none of them is invoked straight from a request.** Each is reached through the scaffolding capability, whose preflight establishes the executable, the inventory and the target directory and asks before every command it runs. A request that already names the template is not an exception: the name says which template and says nothing the preflight asks. One session read a named reference as licence to run `frontx seed` directly and handed back a project with no git repository around it. `list`, `validate` and `help` read rather than write and are invoked directly
- `list --json` is the machine-readable form: one record per installed template carrying its identity, pinned reference, source address, and declared description

## When a request is to create or extend a project

- Route it first — the routing section of this kit's `SKILL.md` maps each kind of request (create, apply a held reference, add a unit, upgrade, validate) to the capability or command that serves it. Read the routing table there; it is the only copy, and restating it here is how the two fall out of step
- **Every capability this kit routes to is a file, reached with the Read tool at its path under the kit root.** A `frontx_`-prefixed name is a resource id, not a registered skill: no Skill tool call resolves it, whatever name is guessed at, and the routing row names the path to read instead. The same holds for the skills a template activated under `.frontx/ai/<template-identity>/` — they are files the apply wrote, read from disk where they sit
- **This kit describes no procedure for adding a unit inside ground an applied template owns** — no MFE package, no screen. That template owns its scaffold, its naming and its registration steps, and states them in the skills it activated under `.frontx/ai/<template-identity>/`. Writing such a procedure here would put solution knowledge in the solution-agnostic base and go stale the moment the template changed

## When working with MFEs

- MFEs register through `@gears-frontx/mfes` DefaultMfeRegistry
- Extension domains control which MFEs may mount (`cpt-frontx-component-extension-domain-governance`)
- Isolation is via blob-URL sandboxing (`cpt-frontx-component-mfe-isolation`)

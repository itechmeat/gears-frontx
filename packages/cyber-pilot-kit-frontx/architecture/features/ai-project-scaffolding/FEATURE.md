## 1. Feature Context

- [x] `p2` - `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-project-scaffolding`

### 1.1 Overview

Closes the selection gap between a developer's stated intent and the template reference the CLI requires: the CLI's apply commands take a template reference the caller must already know, and nothing helps the caller decide which installed template answers "a project with a main menu and two screens". This feature adds two declared agent entry points to the base AI kit - a top-level routing entry that recognizes which FrontX capability a request belongs to, and a scaffolding entry that turns a stated project intent into an application plan, executes it, and then realizes the units the intent names inside the applied ground. The scaffolding entry serves the request that names its template reference outright as well: there the plan's selection collapses to the named reference, and everything the entry point does around selection - establishing the executable, the inventory entry and the target directory, asking before each command, and reporting the applied set - is the same work, needed just as much. Selection matches the intent against the descriptions installed templates declare in their manifests (`cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest`), over the local template inventory only, and the plan is executed strictly by invoking the installed `frontx` executable - one seed for the template that establishes the project, then one add per further distinct template - after which the applied set is reported back to the developer from `.frontx/provenance.json`. Because a template is applied at most once, per-unit multiplicity within a template's own ground is not a second application: the flow realizes it by driving, once per unit, the extension skills that template activates in the project (`cpt-frontx-feature-template-ai-extensions`), and then placing the content the intent states for each unit into the unit that skill created. What the developer receives is therefore a project that realizes the stated intent, not a plan for one. An intent that names **only** units inside ground an applied template already holds, with no template to apply, is not this flow's case at all: the routing entry point sends it straight to that template's own skills (`cpt-frontx-flow-ai-project-scaffolding-route-request`), because there is nothing here to select, plan, or apply. All CDSL behavior is `target` (GREENFIELD - grounded in `cpt-frontx-adr-template-manifest-contract`, `cpt-frontx-adr-solution-ai-content-placement`, `cpt-frontx-adr-ai-driven-upgrade-orchestration`, and DESIGN §3.4).

### 1.2 Purpose

This feature realizes the selection mechanism the existing decisions already fix between them: `cpt-frontx-adr-template-manifest-contract` makes the manifest's declared description the statement a caller chooses a template by, and `cpt-frontx-adr-solution-ai-content-placement` requires a base capability that acts on solutions to read that declaration at invocation time rather than name templates. A template therefore declares what it is in prose the base kit matches an intent against, and the kit reads the installed set over the CLI command surface rather than classifying templates (`cpt-frontx-adr-uniform-template-mechanism` leaves no template kinds to match against) or carrying a built-in map of template names (which `cpt-frontx-adr-solution-ai-content-placement` forbids in the base kit). It extends the agent-facing capability set required by `cpt-frontx-fr-ai-frontx-skills` with the intent-to-application-plan capability, and delivers the AI-guided leg of `cpt-frontx-usecase-ai-driven-project-scaffolding` alongside the direct CLI path, never in place of it.

The process boundary is the same one `cpt-frontx-adr-ai-driven-upgrade-orchestration` established for upgrades and DESIGN §3.4 records as the kit's only coordination edge with the CLI: the kit drives the built `frontx` executable's command surface and neither links `@gears-frontx/cli` nor reproduces any part of what its commands do. Applying this to the assembler as well as the change-set engine is what `cpt-frontx-constraint-kit-orchestrates-not-reimplements` requires; the reporting leg reads the CLI-written provenance record set through the filesystem handoff DESIGN §3.4 already sanctions.

**Requirements**: `cpt-frontx-fr-ai-frontx-skills`, `cpt-frontx-fr-ai-agent-skill-resources`

**Principles**: `cpt-frontx-principle-template-agnostic-tooling` - the entry points name no template and gain their knowledge of the installed set at invocation time, so a newly installed conforming template becomes selectable without a kit change.

**Components**: `cpt-frontx-component-ai-base-kit` (the internal sub-component these entry points ship in), within the package anchor `cpt-frontx-component-ai-tooling-kit`

### 1.3 Actors

| Actor | Role in Feature |
|-------|-----------------|
| `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer` | States the project intent in natural language, chooses between candidates when selection is ambiguous, and receives the application plan, the applied set, the units realized inside the applied ground, and the residual work the applied templates and their extension skills do not cover |
| `cpt-frontx-actor-ai-agent-host` | Surfaces the kit's declared `skill` entry points from their applicability metadata and invokes the routing and scaffolding entry points on the developer's behalf |

### 1.5 Agent Entry-Point Surface

This is the concrete declared shape of the two entry points, owned by this feature; the rules they satisfy are owned by `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-kit-packaging` (KIT-1 prefixing, KIT-4 declared-kind and applicability metadata) and the solution-agnostic admission check by `cpt-frontx-adr-solution-ai-content-placement`.

**Routing entry point** - the kit's existing top-level `skill` resource, whose applicability metadata already covers ecosystem-scoped work, gains the routing responsibility. It is extended, not duplicated: an entry point whose only content is a pointer to one other entry point would add a hop and no capability, and a second resource claiming the same top-level name is not declarable. Its document gains a delimited section that states, for each kind of FrontX request, which capability serves it - including that a request to create a new project is served by the scaffolding entry point below, and that so is a request naming the template reference outright. **A `frontx` command that writes is never named there as a direct route.** The seed, add and upgrade commands each write into a directory the developer keeps, and the ground those writes need - an invocable executable, the named template in the inventory, a target directory under version control - is exactly what the scaffolding entry point's preflight establishes, so a route around it is a route around the questions. The reading commands are named directly, having no ground to establish. This is a body-of-the-document rule rather than a note beside it: a session obeys the routing section it reads, and the one row that offered a direct route to a writing command was the one row a session took.

**Scaffolding entry point** - a new `skill` resource declared in `.cf-studio-kit.toml` with a `frontx_`-prefixed identifier, `kind = "skill"`, `public = true`, a `source` and `install_path` that address a document nested under a directory the kit ships, `type = "file"`, and non-empty applicability metadata in its own document frontmatter stating that it applies whenever a FrontX project is to be created or extended by applying a template - from a stated intent, or from a template reference the developer names outright. The metadata covers both, because it is what an agent host matches a request against: metadata that claimed the intent case alone would leave a named-reference request looking like something this entry point does not serve, which is how such a request came to be executed without it. Neither the resource identifier nor any manifest field names a solution, a framework, or a concrete template, because the manifest's identifier and description fields are scanned against the solution-term list; and neither entry-point document names a concrete template, because resource bodies are scanned against the specific-template-name list. The declared `source` must additionally be covered by the package's published file set, or the resource is declared, validated in the monorepo, and absent from the published package.

Both entry points are documents, not compiled modules: the scaffolding flow is a sequence of one-shot command invocations with no mid-stream protocol to hold open, so it needs no in-kit module at the process boundary and adds none. The realization leg is documents for the same reason and a stronger one: it is carried out by following the instructions an applied template's own activated extension skill states. The base kit contributes the sequencing - which unit, in which order, how many - and the intent-specific content that only the stated intent can supply, and contributes none of the structure, naming, identifiers, or registration, every one of which the template's own skill states. KIT-3's invariant - that the framework holds no code path materializing or modifying a project file - therefore stands unweakened, because the framework ships no such code path on either leg.

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

User-facing interactions that start with an actor and describe the end-to-end flow of a use case. Each flow has a triggering actor and shows how the system responds to actor actions.

**Use cases**: `cpt-frontx-usecase-ai-driven-project-scaffolding`

### Scaffold a Project from a Stated Intent

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-flow-ai-project-scaffolding-scaffold-from-intent`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Developer states an intent naming a URL as the source of what to build - an issue, a ticket, a specification - and the scaffolding entry point retrieves and reads that document before planning, so the plan and the realized units carry what the document states, including the terms the request itself left short.
- Developer states a project intent and a target directory; the scaffolding entry point reads the installed inventory, matches the intent against the templates' declared descriptions, presents the application plan, applies the selected templates through the `frontx` executable, reports the applied set from provenance, realizes each unit the intent names inside the applied ground through the applied templates' activated extension skills, places the content the intent states into each realized unit, and names whatever residual work is left over.
- Developer states an intent naming several units of one kind - a project with a stated number of screens - and receives a project holding one realized unit per stated screen, each carrying that screen's stated content, from a single application of the template whose ground those units live in.
- Developer states an intent against a directory that already holds applied templates; the seed step is omitted and only the further distinct templates are added.

**Error Scenarios**:
- The stated intent names a URL as the source of what to build and no fetch capability is connected for that host: the entry point retrieves the document from the shell instead, authenticating by environment convention where the host refuses the unauthenticated request. No connected tool for a host is not the same as no way to read it, and treating the two as one ends the exchange with the developer asked to supply a document the flow could have fetched.
- Every retrieval route for a named URL fails: the developer is asked, closed and in the language of their request, to supply the content directly or to proceed without the reference, with what cannot be planned without it named. This is the only question the reference raises - a question about what the unread document itself defines asks the developer to answer what reading it would have.
- The target directory holds content but no provenance record set: this is existing work the flow did not start, so no seed is planned against it. The developer is told what was found and offered either a fresh directory to seed into or the add path applied to the directory as it stands - qualified by what that path does with the content found there, since it writes only the ground the applied template declares and refuses, naming the paths, where content already stands on that ground.
- No template is installed in the local inventory: the developer is told that selection has nothing to choose from and how to install a template, and no command that writes files is invoked.
- No installed template's declared description matches the intent: the developer is told which templates are installed and which were not considered because they declare no description, and is asked to restate the intent or install a template that answers it; nothing is guessed and no files are written.
- Two or more installed templates match the project-establishing part of the intent indistinguishably: the developer is asked to choose between the named candidates and their declared descriptions before anything is applied.
- Two or more installed templates match one supplemental part of the intent indistinguishably: the same choice is put to the developer, naming the part and each tied candidate, because the identity applied is the one the project then carries in provenance.
- The target directory holds no applied template and nothing installed claims to establish a project, though something matches a supplemental part: the developer is told which supplemental candidates matched and that none of them lays the ground the others would contribute to, and is asked to install a template that establishes a project or restate the intent; no files are written.
- An installed template's stored manifest no longer satisfies the manifest contract: it is reported as a repairable installation with reinstallation as the remedy, never as a template that declares no description.
- A selected template is already applied in the target directory: it is dropped from the plan and reported as already applied, because a template is applied at most once per project.
- An invoked `frontx` command exits non-zero: the flow stops at that command, relays the CLI's own reported reason without reinterpreting it, invokes no further command, and reports which templates were applied before the failure.
- The provenance record set cannot be read after a command reported success: the developer is told the applied set could not be confirmed and is pointed at the target directory, rather than being shown an applied set that was not read. **The flow stops there and realizes nothing** - realization needs to know which templates are applied, and to read their bundles, so with the applied set unconfirmed it would be building on a guess.
- A unit the intent names falls inside an applied template's ground but no activated extension skill covers that ground: the unit is reported as residual work naming the ground it falls in, and nothing is written into that ground, because the template that owns the ground has declared no way to add a unit to it.
- Realizing a unit fails: the flow stops at that unit, relays the failure's own reported reason without reinterpreting it, names the units realized before it, and realizes no further unit and attempts no correction retry.
- The verification an applied template's extension skill declares fails after the units were created: the flow reports the project as applied and realized but not verified, relays that verification's own output unreinterpreted, and does not report scaffolding complete - a failing type-check or lint is the difference between a project that was written and one that works, and no correction retry is attempted for it either.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Developer states the intent for a project and the target directory, and the agent host invokes the scaffolding entry point. - `inst-sfi-invoke`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the stated intent names a URL as the source of what to build - an issue, a ticket, a specification - the entry point retrieves that document before planning anything and reads it as part of the intent, since it states what is to be built and commonly defines the terms the intent itself leaves short. Retrieval tries, in order and stopping at the first that answers: a fetch capability the agent host has connected for that host; a direct HTTP request issued from the shell, which requires nothing connected; the same request carrying a bearer token found by environment naming convention - the host's name uppercased with `_API_TOKEN` appended - when the unauthenticated request is refused, whether by status code or by a sign-in page returned in place of the content; and the host's API form of the addressed record, derived from the given URL, when the human-facing page requires a browser session. The token is passed by variable reference and its value is never emitted into output, a report, or a file. - `inst-sfi-read-references`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** every retrieval route fails - `inst-sfi-if-reference-unreadable`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** a closed question to the developer offering to receive the document's content directly against proceeding without it, recommending the former and naming what cannot be planned without it. A question is put only here, after the routes above are exhausted; a question raised in place of them asks the developer for something the flow could have obtained, and a question about what the unread document itself defines asks them to supply what reading it would have answered. - `inst-sfi-return-reference-unreadable`
4. [ ] - `p1` - The entry point obtains the installed-template inventory - each entry's identity, pinned reference, declared description, and the marker the listing sets when an entry's stored manifest no longer satisfies the manifest contract (`cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`) - by invoking the CLI's machine-readable listing command through the `frontx` executable's command surface, never by reading the CLI's inventory storage and never from any remote source. The marker is carried, not discarded: without it a broken installation is indistinguishable from a template that declares no description, and the developer is sent to find a better-described template instead of repairing the one they have. - `inst-sfi-read-inventory`
5. [ ] - `p1` - The entry point establishes whether the target directory already holds applied templates by reading its provenance record set, so that the plan omits a seed for a directory that is already a project, **and** whether the directory holds content no provenance accounts for - because absent provenance alone does not license a seed: the CLI refuses to seed over content it did not write, so a plan built on provenance alone can name a seed the CLI will refuse. - `inst-sfi-read-target-state`
6. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the target directory holds content and its provenance record set records no applied template - `inst-sfi-if-target-unowned`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** a refusal naming what the directory holds: this is existing work the flow did not start, so no seed is planned against it. Offer a fresh directory to seed into, or the add path applied to the directory as it stands - qualified by what that path does with the content found there, since it writes only the ground the applied template declares and refuses, naming the paths, where content already stands on that ground - and wait for the developer's choice rather than acting on either. No `frontx` command that writes files is invoked. - `inst-sfi-return-target-unowned`
7. [ ] - `p1` - The entry point invokes the selection algorithm (`cpt-frontx-algo-ai-project-scaffolding-select-templates`) with the intent, the inventory, and the already-applied set. - `inst-sfi-select`
8. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** selection returns a refusal - `inst-sfi-if-refused`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the refusal and its reason to the developer - nothing installed, nothing matched, nothing establishes the project, or a choice required - with no `frontx` command invoked that writes files. - `inst-sfi-return-refused`
9. [ ] - `p1` - The entry point presents the application plan to the developer before executing it: the template to seed with its pinned reference, each further template to add in order, each template dropped as already applied, and the residual intent no installed template's description covers. - `inst-sfi-present-plan`
10. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the plan carries a seed selection - `inst-sfi-if-seed`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - The entry point invokes the CLI's seed command through the `frontx` executable with the selected template's **identity** - the name the inventory record carries, which is what the apply commands take - and the target directory (`cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding`), materializing no file itself. The pinned reference is reported in the plan and never passed as the command's argument. - `inst-sfi-invoke-seed`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the seed command exits non-zero - `inst-sfi-if-seed-failed`
      1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the CLI's reported reason unreinterpreted; no add command is invoked. - `inst-sfi-return-seed-failed`
11. [ ] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** further template in the plan, in plan order - `inst-sfi-foreach-add`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - The entry point invokes the CLI's add command through the `frontx` executable with that template's **identity**, as the seed step above passes it, and the target directory. - `inst-sfi-invoke-add`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the add command exits non-zero - `inst-sfi-if-add-failed`
      1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the CLI's reported reason unreinterpreted, naming the templates applied before the failure; no further add command is invoked. - `inst-sfi-return-add-failed`
12. [ ] - `p1` - The entry point invokes the provenance reporting algorithm (`cpt-frontx-algo-ai-project-scaffolding-report-provenance`) to surface the applied set from the target directory's provenance record set. - `inst-sfi-report-provenance`
13. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the provenance record set is absent or cannot be read - `inst-sfi-if-provenance-unreadable`
    1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the applied set as unconfirmed, naming the target directory, and perform **no** realization step. Realization depends on knowing which templates are applied and on reading their bundles; with the applied set unconfirmed, both are guesses, and a unit created into ground that may not be there is worse than a unit not created. The developer is pointed at the target directory to establish its state before the flow is invoked again. - `inst-sfi-return-provenance-unreadable`
14. [ ] - `p1` - The entry point reads the AI-extension bundles the CLI materialized into the target directory during apply, locating each by its identity-scoped path and each entry by its declared role, so that per-unit work inside an applied template's ground is carried by the capability that template itself declares rather than by any knowledge held in this entry point. This is a read of content already on disk in the current session, **not** the formal discovery-and-activation pass `cpt-frontx-feature-template-ai-extensions` owns: that pass runs on the framework's next invocation and makes the same capabilities available as activated resources thereafter. The bundle convention this read depends on is F16's (`.frontx/ai/<template-identity>/` with its declared entries); the activation lifecycle is not. - `inst-sfi-activate-extensions`
15. [ ] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** unit the plan attributed to an applied template's own ground, in plan order - `inst-sfi-foreach-unit`
    1. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** no activated extension skill covers that template's ground - `inst-sfi-if-no-extension`
       1. [ ] - `p1` - Record the unit as residual work naming the ground it falls in, write nothing into that ground, and continue with the next unit - a template that declares no way to add a unit to its ground is not one this entry point may improvise into. - `inst-sfi-record-uncovered-unit`
    2. [ ] - `p1` - **ELSE** follow the covering extension skill's own instructions once for that unit, creating the unit inside the applied template's ground exactly as that skill directs, and touching no ground that skill does not itself claim. - `inst-sfi-realize-unit`
       1. [ ] - `p1` - Place the content the intent states for that unit into the unit just created, following the same extension skill's conventions, so the delivered unit carries what the developer asked it to carry rather than the scaffold's placeholder content. - `inst-sfi-place-unit-content`
       2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** realizing the unit fails - `inst-sfi-if-unit-failed`
          1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the failure's own reported reason unreinterpreted, naming the applied templates and the units realized before it; no further unit is realized and no correction retry is attempted. - `inst-sfi-return-unit-failed`
16. [ ] - `p1` - The entry point runs the verification each covering extension skill declares for the units it created, so what is handed back is a project that builds and runs rather than one that was merely written. - `inst-sfi-verify-realized`
17. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the intent, or a document it referenced, named a design for what was built, the verification additionally compares each realized screen against its design frame: rendered at the frame's own viewport, captured, and the capture examined against the frame as images. Every geometry difference found - element size, placement, alignment, control width, the rendering of a selected state - is corrected before the screen is reported done; a difference the component library cannot express is recorded and closed with that constraint named. A design named and not compared against leaves its screens unverified against it, and is reported so rather than passed: a screen whose design tokens resolve exactly can still render every box at the wrong size, and a walk that checks console output and interaction alone passes it. - `inst-sfi-compare-design`
18. [ ] - `p1` - The entry point writes the verification coverage record into the project, beside its provenance, on every run that verified anything and before the report is composed - carrying, per screen, what was verified and, where a design was compared against, the comparison outcome with each difference's design value, built value, and fixed-or-closed disposition. The record is owed whichever procedure performed the verification, this feature's own or a covering skill's declared one, because it answers what was verified rather than how; the captures it cites are written inside the project rather than to a temporary location, so a reader can still open them after the session ends. - `inst-sfi-write-coverage`
19. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** a declared verification reports failure - `inst-sfi-if-verify-failed`
    1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the project as applied and realized but **not verified**, relaying that verification's own output unreinterpreted and naming the units it covered; scaffolding complete is not reported, and no correction retry is attempted. - `inst-sfi-return-verify-failed`
20. [ ] - `p1` - The entry point reports as the work remaining only the intent that no applied template's ground contains and no activated extension skill covers; it neither modifies any applied template's content as part of applying it nor retries a failed command in a correction loop. - `inst-sfi-report-residual`
21. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** scaffolding complete - the applied set as read from provenance, the units realized inside the applied ground and verified, plus the residual work. - `inst-sfi-return-done`

### Route a FrontX Request to the Capability That Serves It

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-flow-ai-project-scaffolding-route-request`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-actor-ai-agent-host`

**Success Scenarios**:
- The host invokes the top-level routing entry point for a FrontX request; the entry point identifies the request as one to create a new project and names the scaffolding entry point as the capability that serves it.
- The host invokes the routing entry point for a request that names the template reference outright rather than stating an intent; the entry point names the scaffolding entry point just the same, because the named reference settles the selection and settles nothing the preflight establishes.
- The host invokes the routing entry point for a request the kit's other declared capabilities serve; the entry point names that capability instead.
- The host invokes the routing entry point for a request served by a `frontx` command that only reads - listing the inventory, validating a template, printing usage; the entry point names that command as a direct route, because nothing is written and there is no ground to establish.

**Error Scenarios**:
- The request matches no capability the kit declares: the routing entry point says so and names the capabilities it does declare, rather than routing to the closest one.
- The request names a template reference outright and the routing entry point returns the executable as a direct route: the preflight never runs, so the request is executed by a session that established no executable, no inventory entry and no repository, and asked nothing before writing. A named reference answers which template and answers nothing else, so it is never grounds for bypassing the capability.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - The agent host invokes the top-level routing entry point for a FrontX request stated by the developer. - `inst-rr-invoke`
2. [ ] - `p1` - The routing entry point determines which of the kit's declared capabilities the request belongs to, from the request itself and from whether the working directory already holds applied templates. - `inst-rr-classify`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the request is to create a new project, or to apply a template whose reference the developer named outright - `inst-rr-if-create`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the scaffolding entry point (`cpt-frontx-flow-ai-project-scaffolding-scaffold-from-intent`) as the capability that serves the request. - `inst-rr-return-scaffolding`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the request's execution would end in a `frontx` command that writes into a directory the developer keeps - the seed, add and upgrade commands - and step 3 did not already route it - `inst-rr-if-writing-command`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the scaffolding entry point's preflight as what runs first, and the serving command after it; a command that writes is never returned as a route the host takes directly, because the preflight is what establishes the executable, the inventory and the target directory and puts a closed question before each. - `inst-rr-return-preflight`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the request matches no capability the kit declares - `inst-rr-if-unmatched`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** that no declared capability serves the request, naming the capabilities the kit does declare. - `inst-rr-return-unmatched`
6. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the declared capability that serves the request; a `frontx` command is returned as a direct route only when it reads rather than writes. - `inst-rr-return-capability`

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

Internal system functions and procedures called by actor flows above.

### Select the Application Set from Intent and Declared Descriptions

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-algo-ai-project-scaffolding-select-templates`

**Input**: The developer's stated intent; the installed-template inventory as obtained over the command surface, each entry carrying identity, pinned reference, the description its manifest declares (absent when the entry declares none), and the marker set when the entry's stored manifest no longer satisfies the manifest contract; and the set of template identities already applied in the target directory.

**Output**: An application plan - at most one seed selection, an ordered list of further distinct templates to add, the identities dropped as already applied, the units the intent names inside a selected or already-applied template's own ground each **provisionally** attributed to the template whose description claims that ground, and the residual intent no selected template's description covers and no selected or already-applied template's ground contains - or a refusal naming which of the four refusal reasons applies: nothing installed, nothing matched, nothing establishes the project, or a choice required. The unit attributions are the plan's best reading of the descriptions, not a resolved ownership fact: realization re-resolves each against the applied bundles' declared roles and may find no cover.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Receive the intent, the inventory, and the already-applied identities. - `inst-st-receive`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the request names a template reference outright, take the inventory entry carrying that identity as the selection - the seed selection when no template is applied in the target directory, a further template otherwise - and match descriptions only for whatever the request states beyond it. Description matching exists to find a selection where none was given; run over a named reference it can select a template whose description reads better than the named one's, which is selecting against the developer's own words. A named reference the inventory does not carry is not a no-match refusal but an absent installation, since a name is an identity and not an address. - `inst-st-take-named-reference`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the inventory carries no entry - `inst-st-if-empty`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** a refusal: selection has nothing to choose from, and a template must be installed first. - `inst-st-return-empty`
4. [ ] - `p1` - Partition the inventory into three classes: the entries that declare a description, which alone are candidates because a template that describes nothing offers nothing to match an intent against; the entries that conform and declare none; and the entries whose stored manifest no longer satisfies the manifest contract. Keep the last two apart when recording them as not considered - a conforming template that declares nothing is working as intended and is simply unselectable from an intent, whereas a broken manifest is a repairable installation whose remedy is reinstalling that template. - `inst-st-partition`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** no entry declares a description - `inst-st-if-no-candidates`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** a refusal: nothing matched, listing the installed templates each with its own reason for being skipped - declaring no description, or carrying a manifest that no longer satisfies the contract, the latter naming reinstalling that template as the remedy. - `inst-st-return-no-candidates`
6. [ ] - `p1` - Match the intent against each candidate's declared description, treating the description as the template's own statement of what it establishes and what it contributes, and special-casing no identity, namespace, or naming pattern. - `inst-st-match`
7. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** no candidate's declared description matches any part of the intent - `inst-st-if-no-match`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** a refusal: nothing matched, listing the candidates considered and those skipped, each with its own reason - declaring no description, or an unreadable manifest with reinstallation as its remedy; no nearest-match is chosen. - `inst-st-return-no-match`
8. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the target directory holds no applied template, select as the seed selection the single candidate whose declared description matches the project-establishing part of the intent. - `inst-st-select-seed`
9. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the target directory holds no applied template and no candidate's declared description matches the project-establishing part of the intent, even though some candidate matches a supplemental part - `inst-st-if-no-establishing-match`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** a refusal: nothing establishes the project. Name the supplemental candidates that did match and state that none of them claims to establish a project, so a plan built from them would carry no seed and lay no ground - and a supplemental template contributes *to* a project, leaving nothing for it to contribute to. The refusal rests on that alone and claims nothing about what the CLI's add command would do with such a directory. Ask the developer to install a template that establishes a project, or to restate the intent. Nothing is guessed and no files are written. - `inst-st-return-no-establishing-match`
10. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** two or more candidates match the project-establishing part of the intent indistinguishably - `inst-st-if-ambiguous`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** a refusal: a choice is required, naming each tied candidate with its declared description, because guessing between them would write a project the developer did not ask for. - `inst-st-return-ambiguous`
11. [ ] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** remaining part of the intent, select at most one candidate whose declared description matches it, skipping any candidate already in the plan - a template contributes to a project once, so a part of the intent that repeats a unit the plan already covers adds no second application. - `inst-st-select-further`
    1. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** two or more candidates match that part of the intent indistinguishably - `inst-st-if-ambiguous-further`
       1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the same choice-required refusal the project-establishing tie returns, naming the part of the intent in question and each tied candidate with its declared description. A supplemental contribution is not a lesser decision: picking arbitrarily between two templates that both claim to contribute the same thing applies one the developer never chose, and the identity applied is the one the project then carries in provenance. - `inst-st-return-ambiguous-further`
12. [ ] - `p1` - Drop from the plan every selected identity already applied in the target directory, recording it as already applied, because re-applying an identity claims ground that identity already occupies and the CLI refuses the whole operation. - `inst-st-drop-applied`
13. [ ] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** part of the intent that names a unit within a selected or already-applied template's own ground, record it as one unit of per-unit work **provisionally** attributed to that template - one record per unit the intent names, so an intent naming several units of one kind yields several records against the single application that owns their ground. The attribution is provisional because this algorithm's only evidence is what the templates' descriptions say about the ground they establish; it holds no bundle contents. The authoritative answer comes at realization, where the covering capability is looked up by declared role in the applied template's own bundle (`cpt-frontx-flow-ai-project-scaffolding-scaffold-from-intent`), and a unit no bundle covers takes the explicit no-covering-skill branch there rather than being forced onto the template this step guessed. - `inst-st-record-unit-work`
14. [ ] - `p1` - Record as the residual intent every part of the intent no selected template's declared description covers and no selected or already-applied template's ground contains, so that per-unit work the flow goes on to realize is not reported as work left undone. - `inst-st-record-residual`
15. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the application plan: the seed selection if any, the ordered further templates, the identities dropped as already applied, the per-unit work provisionally attributed to each template, and the residual intent. - `inst-st-return-plan`

### Report the Applied Set from Project Provenance

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-algo-ai-project-scaffolding-report-provenance`

**Input**: The target directory whose apply commands reported success.

**Output**: The applied set as recorded by the CLI - each applied template's identity, the version it was applied from, and its re-resolvable source address - or a report that the applied set could not be confirmed.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Read the target directory's provenance record set, written by the CLI's provenance recorder (`cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`), through the filesystem handoff DESIGN §3.4 sanctions in the kit-reads-project direction. - `inst-rp-read`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the record set is absent or cannot be read - `inst-rp-if-unreadable`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** that the applied set could not be confirmed, naming the target directory; report no applied set that was not read. - `inst-rp-return-unreadable`
3. [ ] - `p1` - Report one entry per record - identity, applied-from version, and source address - as the authoritative applied set, in place of restating what the plan intended to apply. - `inst-rp-report-records`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the reported applied set. - `inst-rp-return-set`

## 4. States (CDSL)

### Application Plan Lifecycle

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-state-ai-project-scaffolding-plan-lifecycle`

**States**: REQUESTED, INVENTORY_READ, PLANNED, SEEDED, EXTENDED, APPLIED_REPORTED, REALIZED, VERIFIED, REFUSED

`APPLIED_REPORTED` is named for what it reports: the applied set has been read back from provenance, and the flow continues into realization. It is not terminal, and naming it `REPORTED` would suggest the developer has been handed a finished result while the units the intent named are still missing. `VERIFIED` is the terminal success state, reached only once the applied templates' own declared verification has passed over the units created.

**Initial State**: REQUESTED

**Transitions**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** REQUESTED **TO** INVENTORY_READ **WHEN** the installed-template inventory and the target directory's already-applied set have been obtained over the command surface. - `inst-pl-req-inventory`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** INVENTORY_READ **TO** PLANNED **WHEN** selection returns an application plan carrying at least one template to apply. - `inst-pl-inventory-planned`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** INVENTORY_READ **TO** REFUSED **WHEN** selection returns a refusal - nothing installed, nothing matched, or a choice required; no command that writes files has been invoked. - `inst-pl-inventory-refused`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** PLANNED **TO** SEEDED **WHEN** the plan's seed selection has been applied by the CLI's seed command exiting successfully, or the plan carried no seed selection because the target already holds applied templates. - `inst-pl-planned-seeded`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** PLANNED **TO** REFUSED **WHEN** the seed command exits non-zero; the CLI's reported reason is relayed and no add command is invoked. - `inst-pl-planned-refused`
6. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** SEEDED **TO** EXTENDED **WHEN** every further template in the plan has been applied by the CLI's add command exiting successfully. - `inst-pl-seeded-extended`
7. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** SEEDED **TO** REFUSED **WHEN** an add command exits non-zero; the templates applied before the failure are named and no further add command is invoked. - `inst-pl-seeded-refused`
8. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** EXTENDED **TO** APPLIED_REPORTED **WHEN** the applied set has been read from the target directory's provenance record set and reported. - `inst-pl-extended-reported`
9. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** EXTENDED **TO** REFUSED **WHEN** the provenance record set is absent or unreadable after every apply command reported success; the applied set is reported as unconfirmed, the target directory is named, and no realization is attempted. - `inst-pl-extended-unconfirmed`
10. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** APPLIED_REPORTED **TO** REALIZED **WHEN** every unit the plan attributed to an applied template's ground has either been created through that template's activated extension skill and filled with the content the intent states for it, or been recorded as residual for want of a covering extension skill; the residual work is reported with the realized units. - `inst-pl-reported-realized`
11. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** APPLIED_REPORTED **TO** REFUSED **WHEN** realizing a unit fails; the units realized before the failure are named, no further unit is realized, and no correction retry is attempted. - `inst-pl-reported-refused`
12. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** REALIZED **TO** VERIFIED **WHEN** the verification each covering extension skill declares has passed over the units it created; this is the terminal success state, and only from it is scaffolding reported complete. - `inst-pl-realized-verified`
13. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** REALIZED **TO** REFUSED **WHEN** a declared verification reports failure; the project is reported as applied and realized but not verified, that verification's own output is relayed unreinterpreted, and no correction retry is attempted. - `inst-pl-realized-refused`

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Declared Agent Entry Points for Routing and Scaffolding

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-ai-project-scaffolding-declared-skill-surface`

The system **MUST** expose both the top-level routing entry point and the scaffolding entry point as kit-manifest resources of kind `skill` with `frontx_`-prefixed identifiers and non-empty applicability metadata in each resource document, extending the existing top-level resource with the routing responsibility rather than declaring a second resource under the same top-level name, and **MUST** keep both resource documents free of any concrete template, solution, or framework name so the solution-agnostic admission check passes (`target`). The routing entry point **MUST** route every request whose execution ends in a `frontx` command that writes - seed, add, upgrade - through the scaffolding entry point's preflight, and **MUST NOT** name any such command as a direct route, including for a request that names its template reference outright: a named reference settles the selection and settles none of the executable, inventory and target-directory ground the preflight establishes. Only the reading commands **MAY** be named as direct routes (`target`).

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-flow-ai-project-scaffolding-route-request`

**Cites**:
- `cpt-frontx-component-ai-base-kit`
- `cpt-frontx-component-ai-tooling-kit`

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-kit-zero-solution-content` - the entry points carry the selection mechanism, and the installed templates carry the names it selects among.

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Kit`
- Resource shape: two `resources[]` entries of `kind = "skill"` with `public = true`, each `source` addressing a shipped document and covered by the package's published file set
- No API surface; no persistent database

**Verifiable clauses**:
- [ ] Both entry points appear in the shipped manifest as `kind = "skill"`, `public = true`, with identifiers matching the `frontx_` prefix rule
- [ ] Each entry point's document carries non-empty applicability metadata in its frontmatter
- [ ] Each declared `source` exists on disk and is covered by the package's published file set
- [ ] Neither entry-point document nor either manifest entry names a concrete template, solution, or framework

### Selection Is Description-Matched over the Local Inventory Only

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-ai-project-scaffolding-description-matched-selection`

The system **MUST** select the templates to apply by matching the developer's stated intent against the descriptions installed templates declare in their manifests, over the local template inventory obtained through the CLI command surface and no other source, special-casing no template identity or namespace; and **MUST** refuse - reporting nothing installed, nothing matched, or a choice required, and writing no files - rather than choosing a nearest match, consulting any remote source, or falling back to a template name built into the kit (`target`).

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-flow-ai-project-scaffolding-scaffold-from-intent`

- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-template-resolver`

**Constraints**: (none owned by this feature)

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Template`
- No API surface; no persistent database

### The Kit Drives Scaffolding Only Through the Command Surface

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-ai-project-scaffolding-command-surface-only`

The system **MUST** apply every selected template by invoking the installed `frontx` executable's seed and add commands, and **MUST NOT** import `@gears-frontx/cli`, read the CLI's inventory storage, materialize or modify any project file as part of applying a template, or reproduce any part of resolution, assembly, conflict checking, or provenance writing - relaying each command's own reported reason on a non-zero exit and stopping rather than retrying in a correction loop. Content placed into a unit an activated extension skill has just created, following that skill's conventions, is not an application and is outside this prohibition: the unit's structure comes from the template's own skill, no template is applied a second time, and the base kit holds no code path that writes any of it, so no second assembler comes into existence (`target`).

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-flow-ai-project-scaffolding-scaffold-from-intent`

**Cites**:
- `cpt-frontx-component-ai-base-kit`
- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-assembler`

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-kit-orchestrates-not-reimplements` - the rule that the framework orchestrates rather than reimplements a CLI engine applies to the assembler on this path exactly as it applies to the change-set engine on the upgrade path.

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Template`, `Assembly`
- Command surface: the built `frontx` executable's listing, seed, and add commands (`cpt-frontx-interface-cli`)
- No API surface; no persistent database

### At Most One Application per Template Identity

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-ai-project-scaffolding-single-application-per-identity`

The system **MUST** plan at most one application per template identity per project - dropping and reporting as already applied any selected identity the target directory's provenance already records, and never planning a second application of an identity already in the plan - and **MUST** realize repetition of a unit within an applied template's own ground by driving that template's activated extension skills once per unit, rather than by a further application, because a second application of one identity re-claims ground that identity already occupies and the CLI refuses the whole operation. Attributing the repetition is therefore not where the obligation ends: the units are carried out, and only a unit whose ground no activated extension skill covers is handed back as residual (`target`).

- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-conflict-checker`

**Constraints**: (none owned by this feature)

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Template`, `OwnershipBoundary`, `ProjectProvenance`, `AiExtension`
- No API surface; no persistent database

### The Applied Set Is Reported from Provenance

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-ai-project-scaffolding-provenance-reported`

The system **MUST** report the applied set after applying by reading the target directory's provenance record set and surfacing each record's identity, applied-from version, and source address, and **MUST** report that the applied set could not be confirmed - rather than restating what the plan intended to apply - when that record set is absent or unreadable after a command reported success (`target`).

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-flow-ai-project-scaffolding-scaffold-from-intent`

**Cites**:

**Constraints**: (none owned by this feature)

**Touches**:
- Entities: `ProjectProvenance`
- Filesystem handoff: the CLI-written provenance record set, read in the kit-reads-project direction (DESIGN §3.4)
- No API surface; no persistent database

### The Ecosystem Is Enabled for Intent-Driven Scaffolding

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-ai-project-scaffolding-ecosystem-enabled`

The system **MUST** leave the ecosystem in a state where the capability is reachable and correctly described: every template the repository publishes declares a description, since a capability that selects on declared descriptions demonstrates nothing while no shipped template declares one; and the repository's own developer documentation describes scaffolding as an operation a kit capability drives from a stated intent alongside the direct CLI path, replacing any statement that scaffolding is not a kit capability, since a document contradicting the architecture is a defect even where the code is right (`target`).

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-flow-ai-project-scaffolding-scaffold-from-intent`

**Cites**:
- `cpt-frontx-component-ai-base-kit`

**Constraints**: (none owned by this feature)

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Template`
- Resource shape: each published template's manifest description (schema owned by `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest`)
- Developer documentation: the repository's quick-start description of which operations a kit capability drives
- No API surface; no persistent database

**Verifiable clauses**:
- [ ] Every template manifest the repository publishes declares a non-empty description of what that template establishes and contributes
- [ ] No developer document states that scaffolding is not a kit capability
- [ ] The developer documentation names the routing and scaffolding entry points as the path every applying operation takes, whether the developer states an intent or names the template reference outright, and names as directly invocable only the `frontx` commands that read
- [ ] No bundled document offers a direct route to `frontx seed`, `frontx add` or `frontx upgrade`; the routing section, the standing agent rules and the scaffolding document tell one story about it, so a session obeys the same rule whichever of them it read
- [ ] An intent naming a URL as the source of what to build is planned from that document's content, retrieved before planning: with a connected fetch capability where one addresses the host, from the shell where none does, and with a bearer token found by environment naming convention where the host refuses the unauthenticated request
- [ ] A token used to retrieve a named reference is passed by variable reference and appears in no output, report, or file the run produces
- [ ] The developer is asked about a named reference only after every retrieval route has failed, and is never asked to define what the referenced document itself defines, nor to classify a target directory state the flow's own rule settles by looking
- [ ] Where the intent or a document it referenced named a design, every realized screen was rendered at the design frame's viewport, captured, and compared against that frame as images; a screen not so compared is reported as unverified against the design rather than as verified
- [ ] Every geometry difference the comparison found is recorded with the design's value and the built value, and was corrected before the screen was reported done - or closed with the component-library constraint that prevents it, never with a bare note
- [ ] The verification coverage record exists in the project beside its provenance on every run that verified anything, whichever procedure performed the verification, and the captures it cites live inside the project rather than in a temporary location

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `architecture/features/ai-project-scaffolding/FEATURE.md` exists with all template sections in order.
- [ ] The kit declares a top-level routing entry point and a scaffolding entry point as `skill` resources with `frontx_`-prefixed identifiers, `public = true`, and non-empty applicability metadata in each document; the kit's own validation suite asserts each declared `source` exists and is covered by the published file set. (`target`)
- [ ] Neither entry-point document nor either manifest entry names a concrete template, solution, or framework, and the solution-agnostic admission check passes over the shipped resource bodies. (`target`)
- [ ] Stating a project intent in a directory with templates installed yields an application plan naming the template to seed with its pinned reference and each further template to add, presented before any command that writes files is invoked. (`target`)
- [ ] The selectable set is obtained by invoking the CLI's machine-readable listing command over the command surface; no code path reads the CLI's inventory storage and no code path consults a remote source. (`target`)
- [ ] A template that declares no description is excluded from matching and reported as not considered; it remains applicable by its exact reference through the direct CLI path. (`target`)
- [ ] Selection refuses with no files written when nothing is installed, when no declared description matches the intent, when a greenfield target has no project-establishing match though a supplemental part matched, and when two or more candidates match indistinguishably - whether on the project-establishing part or on a supplemental one - the tie refusals naming each tied candidate and its declared description. (`target`)
- [ ] An entry whose stored manifest no longer satisfies the manifest contract is reported as a repairable installation with reinstallation named as the remedy, distinguishably from an entry that conforms and declares no description. (`target`)
- [ ] A selected identity already recorded in the target directory's provenance is dropped from the plan and reported as already applied, and no plan ever carries one identity twice. (`target`)
- [ ] Repetition of a unit within an applied template's own ground is realized through that template's activated extension skills as part of the flow, not planned as a further application - an intent naming several units of one kind yields several realized units from the single application that owns their ground. (`target`)
- [ ] The content the intent states for each unit is present in the unit the flow created, so a realized unit carries what the developer asked for rather than the scaffold's placeholder content. (`target`)
- [ ] A unit whose ground no activated extension skill covers is reported as residual work naming that ground, and nothing is written into it. (`target`)
- [ ] A failure while realizing a unit stops the flow at that unit, relays the failure's own reported reason, names the units realized before it, and attempts no correction retry. (`target`)
- [ ] A failing verification declared by a covering extension skill is reported as applied and realized but not verified, relaying that verification's own output, and scaffolding complete is not reported; no correction retry is attempted. (`target`)
- [ ] Every applied template is applied by invoking the installed `frontx` executable; the kit holds no import of `@gears-frontx/cli` and no code path that materializes or modifies a project file. (`target`)
- [ ] A non-zero exit from an invoked command stops the flow at that command, relays the CLI's own reported reason, names the templates applied before the failure, and invokes no further command and no correction retry. (`target`)
- [ ] After applying, the applied set is reported from the target directory's provenance record set - identity, applied-from version, and source address per record - and an unreadable record set is reported as an unconfirmed applied set, after which the flow stops and realizes nothing. (`target`)
- [ ] Every template the repository publishes declares a non-empty manifest description, so the capability is demonstrable against the shipped templates. (`target`)
- [ ] No developer document states that scaffolding is not a kit capability; the documentation names the intent-driven path and the unchanged direct CLI path side by side. (`target`)
- [ ] A project scaffolded through this flow from templates that declare descriptions realizes the stated intent - every unit the intent names is present in the delivered project, carrying the content stated for it - and builds and runs in a browser without errors, verified end to end against the installed templates. (`target`)

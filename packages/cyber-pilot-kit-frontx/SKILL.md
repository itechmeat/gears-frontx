description: "Entry point for any request naming FrontX or frontx - \"frontx, build me a console\", create or scaffold a FrontX project from what the developer wants built, apply or upgrade a FrontX template, add a screen or MFE to one, or understand the ecosystem's MFE runtime substrate, GTS type system, API protocol surface, CLI and package boundaries. Routes the request to the capability that serves it, and carries the preflight that installs whatever the request needs before it runs. Solution-agnostic base only."

# FrontX AI Tooling Kit

Provides AI agents with ecosystem-level fluency for FrontX projects, and routes
a FrontX request to the capability that serves it.

<!-- frontx:routing:begin -->

## Request Routing

Read this before answering a FrontX request. Decide from the request itself and
from whether the working directory already holds applied templates - a
`.frontx/provenance.json` with records means it does.

| The request is to | Served by |
|---|---|
| Create a new project from what the developer wants to be built, holding no reference to start from | `frontx_project_scaffolding` - matches the stated intent against what the installed inventory declares, applies the chosen set through the `frontx` executable, and realizes the units the intent names |
| Apply a specific template whose reference the developer already holds | The `frontx` executable directly - `frontx seed` for a new repository, `frontx add` for an existing one. This path is unchanged and needs no capability here |
| Add a unit inside ground an applied template already owns - one more screen, one more isolated UI unit | The skills that applied template activates in this project, discovered under `.frontx/ai/<template-identity>/`. The base kit adds no unit itself |
| Move an applied template to a newer version | `frontx upgrade <projectRoot> <targetVersion>` directly, or its `--json` form, which emits the change set for review and reads a decision back before anything is applied |
| Understand the ecosystem - runtime substrate, type system, API surface, package boundaries | This document and the guidelines it ships with |
| Check that a template is publishable | The `frontx` executable directly - `frontx validate <templateDir>` |

If the request matches none of these, say so and name the capabilities above.
Do not route it to the closest one; a capability applied to a request it does
not serve produces a confident wrong answer.

**Each capability above is a document installed under this kit root, and the
route is not the capability.** `frontx_project_scaffolding` is
`skills/project-scaffolding/SKILL.md`, relative to this document; the standing
agent rules are `AGENTS.md` beside it, and the package-boundary guidelines are
under `guidelines/`. Open the routed document and follow it - this table names
which one serves the request and nothing more, so a request routed here and then
answered from this page alone has been answered without the steps that serve it.
That holds wherever this kit root sits: alongside the other Constructor Studio
kits, or on its own as an agent skill the `frontx` CLI deployed.

## Packages

| Package | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `@gears-frontx/mfes` | Ecosystem | MFE runtime substrate — registration, loading, isolation, mediation |
| `@gears-frontx/gts-plugin` | Ecosystem | GTS default type-system plugin |
| `@gears-frontx/api` | Ecosystem | API protocol surface — handler-agnostic fetch, cache sharing |
| `@gears-frontx/cli` | Ecosystem | Template resolution CLI — zero bundled template content (CLI-1) |
| `@gears-frontx/cyber-pilot-kit-frontx` | Ecosystem | This AI tooling kit |

## Architecture Principles

- **CLI-1**: CLI has zero dependency on any template; resolves by source-spec at runtime.
- **KIT-1**: All resource identifiers in this kit carry the `frontx_` prefix.
- **MFES-2 / MFES-3**: MFE packages do not depend on template packages.
- **API-1**: API package is handler-agnostic; mocks are template territory.
- **GTS-PLUGIN-2**: GTS plugin ships no solution schemas; schemas are template territory.

## Key Concepts

- **MFE** (Microfrontend): isolated UI unit registered through the MFE registry.
- **Extension domain**: capability grouping that governs which MFEs may mount in a given area.
- **Source-spec**: `host:owner/repo[//subtree]@ref` — the address the CLI resolves to a template at runtime; the optional `//subtree` addresses a template occupying a subdirectory of a repository.
- **Template**: an external project-type deliverable (not bundled into core packages).
- **Constructor Studio kit**: declarative content bundle installable via `cfs kit install`.
